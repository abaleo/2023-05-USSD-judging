# Wrong amount of USSD being minted initially

## Summary
In the whitePaper it is clearly stated that initially `1000` USSD will be minted. As stated here `USSD coin is ’initialized’ with one-time minting of 1000 USSD, taking 1000 DAI as collateral` but this isn't the actual case because `USSD.sol` is being initialize with the minting of `10_000` USSD.

Also as initial DAI are not being transferred into the contract too so ussd are being minted on the cost of other users, leading to inflation and less value for further ussd to be minted by users of ussd.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The discrepancy between the expected and actual initial minting amount may lead to confusion and a potential inconsistency between the whitepaper and the implemented contract. It is crucial to ensure that the contract aligns with the specifications mentioned in the whitepaper to maintain transparency and clarity for users and stakeholders.

Also as the whitepaper states:
```solidity
USSD coin is ’initialized’ with one-time minting of 1000 USSD, taking 1000
DAI as collateral.

```

But in code there are no dai being transferred into the the contract. So actually the contract is minting 10_000 ussd on the cost of other users that will use the protocol. 

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L31-L43

```solidity
function initialize(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol
    ) public initializer {
        __Context_init_unchained();
        __AccessControl_init_unchained();
        __ERC20_init_unchained(name, symbol);

        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _msgSender());

        // mint 10k USSD to create initial pool
        _mint(msg.sender, 10_000 * 1e6);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, the initialize function in the USSD.sol contract should be updated to mint the correct amount of 1,000 USSD tokens during initialization.

Also add a line which transfer the initial amount of dai into the contract whether it be 1000 or 10000.
