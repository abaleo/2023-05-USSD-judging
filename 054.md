# Incorrect address of BTC/USD price feed in StableOracleWBTC.sol

## Summary

In the StableOracleWBTC.sol, incorrect address of price feed is used although in the comments it's written correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the constructor of the mentioned contract, BTC/USD price feed is initialized with the following address: 0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419. But this address is for ETH/USD price feed. The correct one is 0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c

## Impact

High-risk vulnerability. The protocol will get the wrong prices for BTC/USD (for ETH/USD instead) and this will cause the issues in all of the functions where this price feed will be requested.
