# Infinite approval of arbitrary tokens

## Summary

Infinite approval for any token to the unsiswap router contract can be done by everyone.
In general it is not recommend to approve an infinite ammount of tokens to any contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [USSD.sol:242-246](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L242-246) the `approveToRouter` function is public and is giving an infinite approval for a caller specified to the stored `uniRouter` address. In general it is not recommended to give an infinite approval to another contract, but only give the required approval for the action, and revoke any unnecessary approvals afterwards.
In this specific case it is even worse, as everybode can call the functions and give approvals.

## Impact

In case there is a vulnerability in the contract stored in `uniRouter` all Funds of the contract are at risk

## Recommendation
