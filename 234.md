# Not possible to redeem USSD for DAI, only deposit.

## Summary
There is only a `mintForToken` but not a redeem function. Users who deposit `DAI` for `USSD` can only get them back using the uniswap pool. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can deposit `DAI` in the `USSD` contract to receive the `USSD` stablecoin. However it's not possible to get their collateral back. They would only be able to trade their `USSD` on uniswap. Depending on the amount this will result in loss of funds due to slippage.

## Impact
If users want to get their collateral back they need to swap on the pool which is suboptimal since the protocol needs to call rebalance. 
The price of the pool will be skewed until rebalance is called and the users might lose funds due to slippage or be stuck if they don't want to incur the slippage.

According to the whitepaper: 
>Include DAI as part of the collateral to enhance usability and liquidity in
USSD stablecoin. Users will be able to redeem DAI in exchange for USSD
at any time. DAI was selected as the safe and decentralized stablecoin in
the market at the time of USSD creation
