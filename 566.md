# Lack of safeguards in USSD.UniV3SwapInput()

## Summary
The USSD contract has an important safeguard commented out and a potential risk of slippage due to improper parameter value in the `UniV3SwapInput` function. The commented-out `deadline` and a zero value for `amountOutMinimum` raise significant concerns about market volatility and transaction security.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `UniV3SwapInput` function has its deadline parameter commented out, which means there is no limit to how long a transaction can remain pending. Consequently, market conditions may change unfavorably during this indefinite period.

Moreover, the `amountOutMinimum` parameter is set to 0, effectively removing the protection against excessive slippage. Slippage occurs when the market price of an asset changes while a trade is being processed, resulting in a lesser amount of output asset than anticipated.

## Impact
The combination of these vulnerabilities can subject the users to potentially considerable financial losses due to market volatility and unfavorable execution prices.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is strongly advised to uncomment the deadline parameter in the `UniV3SwapInput` function to ensure that transactions do not remain pending indefinitely, thus protecting users from potential market volatility during extended transaction processing times.

Furthermore, it is crucial to set a non-zero `amountOutMinimum` to prevent excessive slippage during trades. A protective measure like this will safeguard users from receiving less output asset than expected due to price fluctuations.
