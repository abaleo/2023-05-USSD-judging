# WBTC depeg risk

## Summary

The chainlink BTC/USD oracle is used to price WBTC. WBTC is basically a bridged asset and if the bridge is compromised/fails then WBTC will depeg and will no longer be equivalent to BTC. This will lead to large amounts of borrowing against an asset that is now effectively worthless. Since the protocol still values it via BTC/USD the protocol will not only be stuck with the bad debt but they will also continue to give out bad loans and increase the amount of bad debt further.

## Vulnerability Detail

WBTC shouldn't be considered equivalent of BTC. Think of the wormhole attack where WETH was minted with no backing ETH. Furthermore, there are already recent incidents where WBTC continually traded as a discounted price to BTC following the collapse of FTX. 

In case of a depegging event of WBTC, chainlink will continue to report the BTC/USD quote, but the collateral value will not be updated in the system. As a result, users will be able to borrow more USSD than what they should.

## Impact

Protocol will take on a large amount of bad debt should WBTC bridge become compromised and WBTC depegs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Use a double oracle setup. Use both the Chainlink and another on-chain liquidity base oracle (i.e. UniV3 TWAP). If the price of the on-chain liquidity oracle drops below a certain threshold of the Chainlink oracles (i.e. 2% lower), any borrowing should be immediately halted. The chainlink oracle will prevent price manipulation and the liquidity oracle will safeguard against the asset depegging.

- Chainlink also has a [WBTC/BTC](0xfdFD9C85aD200c506Cf9e21F1FD8dd01932FBB23) oracle. The peg status could be checked by using this oracle. Ref: Chainlink [docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses).
