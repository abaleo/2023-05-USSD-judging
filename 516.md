# Price calculation is not correct

## Summary
USSD price calculation in `getOwnValuation` function is not correct.

## Vulnerability Detail
`USSD` price calculation is correct when `USSD` is `token0`, but when `USSD` is `token1`, it's not correct.

Let's call `sq` to be `sqrtPriceX96` from uniswap pool.

When `USSD` is token1:
P(USSD)  = (10^12 * 2^192) / (sq^2)

Since we scale it to 10^6, correct return value from the function has to be `(10^18 * 2^192) / (sq^2)`

But from the calculation in the code, it is `(2^192) / (sq^2 * 10^6)`, which is completely different.

## Impact
This issue is severe because the price calculation is the most basic stuff of rebalancing, it will directly affect to the USSD price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update price calculation to match `(10^18 * 2^192) / (sq^2)` when USSD is token1 in uniswap pool.
