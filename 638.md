# Incorrect logic operatation

## Summary
In `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function, logic operation in if statement is not correct.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L199

Here it uses `||` in if statement which is always true.
I believe the original purpose was to check if the collateral token is not either DAI or USSD.
So it has to be `&&`.

## Impact
It does not impact the protocol directly, but it might try to sell DAI for DAI(not sure if DAI is included in the collateral).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace `||` with `&&`
