# Removing collateral token changes order in array

## Summary

Removing collateral token changes order in array.

## Vulnerability Detail

`USSD.sol:removeCollateral()` removes from the `collateral` array the token at a certain index and moves the last token of the array to that index.

When `USSDRebalancer.sol:rebalance()` is called, the order in which collateral tokens are bought and sold is determined by the order they have in the `collateral` array.

## Impact

Removing a collateral token will also change the order in which tokens are bought and sold when rebalancing.

## Recommendation

```diff
    function removeCollateral(uint256 _index) public onlyControl  {
-       collateral[_index] = collateral[collateral.length - 1]; 
+       for (uint i = _index; i < collateral.length - 1; i++) {
+           collateral[i] = collateral[i + 1];
+       }
        collateral.pop();
    }
```
