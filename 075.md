# No slippage protection for swaps

## Summary

No slippage protection for swaps.

## Vulnerability Detail

The swap executed in `UniV3SwapInput` function sets the parameter `amountOutMinimum` to zero, which means that the swap is executed without slippage protection.

## Impact

The swap can be front run and the protocol receive less tokens than expected.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Use the calculated output tokens with certain error margin as the value for `amountOutMinimum`.
