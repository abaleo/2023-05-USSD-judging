# getOwnValuation doesn't always calculate the price correctly

## Summary
`getOwnValuation` doesn't calculate the price correctly when USSD is token1.

## Vulnerability Detail
Rebalance determine if a peg-down or a peg-up recovery is needed and execute it. To do so it checks if `ownval < 1e6 - threshold` for a peg-down recovery and `ownval > 1e6 + threshold` for a peg-up recovery. This means that if the price returned by `getOwnValuation` is 1.05e6 a peg-up recovery will be done, thus USSD will be minted and traded against DAI. This means that in this case the USSD was more valuable than DAI, with 1 USSD you could buy 1.05 DAI.
This shows that the `ownval` is supposed to be how much DAI are needed to buy 1 USSD.

[USSDRebalancer.sol#L92-L107](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L92-L107)
```solidity
    function rebalance() override public {
      uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation();
      (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
      if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
        // peg-down recovery
        BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
      } else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
        // mint and buy collateral
        // never sell too much USSD for DAI so it 'overshoots' (becomes more in quantity than DAI on the pool)
        // otherwise could be arbitraged through mint/redeem
        // the execution difference due to fee should be taken into accounting too
        // take 1% safety margin (estimated as 2 x 0.5% fee)
        IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100); // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
        SellUSSDBuyCollateral();
      }
    }
```

Now that we assessed that the `getOwnValuation` function is supposed to calculate be how much DAI are needed to buy 1 USSD (the USSD price in terms of DAI), let's see what it does. The function can return two prices depending on whether or not USSD correspond to `uniPool.token0()`:


[USSDRebalancer.sol#L70-L80](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L70-L80)
```solidity
    /// @dev get price estimation to DAI using pool address and uniswap price
    function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
      if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
      } else {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
        // flip the fraction
        price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
      }
    }
```
However, in practice, the `sqrtPriceX96` variable will always be the same because otherwise it would be rounded down to 0.
For example, for the [USDC / ETH pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8ad599c3A0ff1De082011EFDDc58f1908eb6e6D8#readContract#F11), `sqrtPriceX96 == 1858229081624998991769857742461947`, `token0 == USDC`, `token1 == WETH`.

-> 1800 USDC = 1 ETH
-> 1800 * 1e6 units of USDC = 1 * 1e18 units of ETH
-> 1 units of USDC = 1 * 1e18 units of ETH / (1800 * 1e6)
-> 1 units of USDC = (1 / 1800) * (1e18 / 1e6) units of ETH
-> 1 units of USDC = (1 / 1800) * (1e18 / 1e6) units of ETH
-> 1 units of USDC = 5.55e-4 * 1e12 units of ETH
-> 1 units of USDC = 5.55e8 units of ETH
Or 1 units of ETH = 1.8e-9 units of USDC
As you can see it would be impossible to store the square root of the later because the price needs to be a whole number. USDC / ETH pool have the same decimals as USSD / DAI for which the same problem will occur. This is why `sqrtPriceX96` is stored as `1858229081624998991769857742461947` which give a price of  `1858229081624998991769857742461947 * 1858229081624998991769857742461947 / (1 << 192) = 550097077`
Therefore, here what is stored in the `sqrtPriceX96` variable is `550097077 ~ 5.5e8`, how many units of ETH are necessary to buy 1 USDC,  because storing `1.8e-9 ~ 0` would not be possible.
This shows why it is not necessary to have two different prices calculated depending on whether USSD is token0 or not. Instead, only one price can be stored depending on the decimals of the tokens.

As a consequence, if USSD is token1, the price will get miscalculated.


## Impact
When USSD is token1 the USSD calculation will be wrong.

## Recommendation
Consider making this change:

```solidity
    /// @dev get price estimation to DAI using pool address and uniswap price
    function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
+      price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
-      if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
-        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
-      } else {
-        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
-        // flip the fraction
-        price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
-      }
    }
```
