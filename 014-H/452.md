# Price calculation susceptible to overflows

## Summary

The contract uses `slot0` values to calculate the price. The current implementation is however susceptible to overflows, and can revert, blocking functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract implements the poolPrice function to get the spot price of the derivative asset using a Uniswap V3 pool. The function queries the pool to fetch the sqrtPriceX96 and does the following calculation:

The main issue here is that the multiplications in the expression `sqrtPriceX96 * (uint(sqrtPriceX96)) * (1e18)` may eventually overflow. This case is taken into consideration by the implementation of the [OracleLibrary.getQuoteAtTick](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/periphery/libraries/OracleLibrary#getquoteattick) function which is part of the Uniswap V3 periphery set of contracts.

https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/libraries/OracleLibrary.sol#L49-L69

Note that this implementation guards against different numerical issues. In particular, the if in line 58 checks for a potential overflow of sqrtRatioX96 and switches the implementation to avoid the issue.

## Impact

Broken contract due to integer overflows. DOS to users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the uniswap library implementation of the sqrt function to avoid overflows.
