# getOwnValuation() will underflow when price is greater than 1e12

## Summary
If the token is not USSD and the price returned from

 `price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);`

is greater than 1e12 the returned value for `getOwnValuation()` will be zero even though the price was not actually 0. this will lead to incorrect calculation in rebalance resulting in the protocol calling `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` when it shouldnt. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Price is received here

 `price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);`

It is possible for this value to be greater than 1e12. And this will cause an price to be 0 due to the next line: 

`price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12; `


Here is an example. If you run this function you will see that the return value is 0. 
```solidity
    function flip(uint256 price /*this would go where 1e13 is*/) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (1e24 / 1e13) / 1e12; // Returns 0
    }    
```
## Impact
Protocol will incorrectly return 0 when the price is not actually 0. Leading to `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` being called when it shouldn't. this will ruin the balance of the stablecoin.

## Recommendation
Use a different formula to "flip the fraction". that wont lead to an underflow. It is important that the numerator is greater than the denominator.
