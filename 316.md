# getPriceUSD() function at the StableOracleDAI.sol returns an incorrect value

## Summary

See Vulnerability Detail

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `getPriceUSD()` at the `StableOracleDAI.sol` contract is supposed to return how much USD, 1 DAI is worth, this is computed with the following formula:

```solidity

return
   (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
   ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```

Which seems correct, but a wrong assumption on the value of `price` makes it incorrect. Lets analyze it.

`wethPriceUSD` is computed as: `uint256 wethPriceUSD = ethOracle.getPriceUSD();` which quoting the interface it should return how much USD, 1 ETH is worth with 18 decimals.

`DAIWethPrice` is computed as:

```solidity
uint256 DAIWethPrice = DAIEthOracle.quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
      1000000000000000000, // 1 Eth
      0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2, // WETH (base token)
      0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F, // DAI (quote token)
      pools, // DAI/WETH pool uni v3
      600 // period
);
```

Again, quoting the interface, `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` returns: 

`Amount of quoteToken received for baseAmount of baseToken`.  

In this case `quoteToken` is DAI, so it returns how much DAI, 1 ETH is worth with 18 decimals.

And lastly `price` is computed as:

```solidity
(, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```

The error is here, the developer assumes that this price returned by chainlink corresponds to how much DAI, 1 ETH is worth with 8 decimals.

In reality the value returned is the opposite, it returns how much ETH, 1 DAI is worth and it has 18 decimals. This can be confirmed putting the address used in the contract which is `0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4` in Etherscan and calling `decimals()` and `latestRoundData()`.

## Impact

In this case the price of DAI in USD will be under estimated causing a loss for the user who mints USSD using DAI as collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Inverse the value returned by chainlink, and remember that it already has 18 decimals.

Or better use the chainlink price feed for DAI / USD which is `0xAed0c38402a5d19df6E4c03F4E2DceD6e29c1ee9`
