# ethOracle is equal to zero

## Summary
The `ethOracle` in `StableOracleDAI` is not set and is equal to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

## Vulnerability Detail
L30 is marked as a TODO but is not set. Assuming that these contracts are final, this line will cause a collapse of the oracle and the protocol.
`ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000);`

## Impact
`StableOracleDAI` is broken and doesn't work as intended
