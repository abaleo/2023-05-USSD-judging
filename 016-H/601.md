# Multiple incorrect oracle configurations will lead to drastically incorrect prices for collateral

## Summary

There are multiple incorrect oracle configurations across many of the listed collateral types, which will lead to incorrect prices being returned

## Vulnerability Detail

Issues with the oracles include the following:

1. The StableOracleWBTC oracle for wBTC is utilizing the address for the wETH/USD oracle rather than the BTC/USD oracle. This is set in the constructor & so cannot be changed:
```solidity
constructor() {
    priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
        0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419
    );
}
```
2. The StableOracleDAI oracle has set the address of the oracle for ETH/USD to be `address(0)`, which is invalid:
```solidity
ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000);
```
3. The StableOracleDAI oracle assumes that the DAIEthOracle price feed has 8 digits of precision, when it actually has 18 digits. This results in the incorrect price being calculated:
```solidity
uint256 wethPriceUSD = ethOracle.getPriceUSD();

(, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();

return
    (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
    ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```

## Impact

The incorrect oracle configurations will lead to incorrect prices being returned, breaking the functionality of the protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Firstly ensure that all addresses used for utilized oracles are correct. Then ensure that the decimals of precision being used are correct.
