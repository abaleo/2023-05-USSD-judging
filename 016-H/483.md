# A number of similar problems with contracts that are supposed to interact with Oracles.

## Summary

Contracts StableOracleDAI, StableOracleWBGL, and StableOracleWBTC have incorrect data. To avoid submitting several similar issues I'd like to mention them all in this submission.
On the one side, it shouldn't cause any losses of funds and in theory, after deploying the whole dAPP and finding out that it doesn't work, developers should only redeploy all these contracts. But properly receiving data from Oracle is one of the most important parts of this dAPP. And this is not just a one-place problem. It's a complex problem in 3 contracts. So I think it should be at least medium severity.

## Vulnerability Detail

**Contract StableOracleDAI**

1. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L23-L31

    constructor() {
        priceFeedDAIETH = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4  //@audit - from the Whitepaper we know that the dAPP works with WETH, not ETH, and even if it's supposed to be 1:1, WETH is an  ERC-20 token and ETH is a native Token.
        );
        DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e //@audit This is an address of UniswapV3 WBGL/WETH pool, not a DAIEthOracle
        );
        ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000); // TODO: WETH oracle price
    } //@audit 0x0 address is not an Oracle and it's impossible to use it like a contract address and to call any function.

2.  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L33-L42

The contract is trying to call a `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` function from the address: 0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e

But there is no such function at this address. This function is from a custom project: https://github.com/Mean-Finance/uniswap-v3-oracle/blob/main/README.md 

And it is supposed to be called from this address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xB210CE856631EeEB767eFa666EC7C1C57738d438
The current code simply reverts.

3.  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#LL44C1-L44C1

This code reverts as there is nothing at the 0x0 address.

**StableOracleWBGL**

1. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBGL.sol#L24-L34

The same situation with the `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` function, The code simply reverts. The function should be called from https://etherscan.io/address/0xB210CE856631EeEB767eFa666EC7C1C57738d438

**StableOracleWBTC**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L15-L19

0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419 is an address of ETH/USD Chainlink price feed, so it has nothing to do with WBTC oracles and will return a price of ETH. And I think it's a simple copypasta from the StableOracleWETH contract.

## Impact

Three of four contracts don't work - either revert either return data for other coins.

## Recommendation

Check all addresses in Oracle contracts.
