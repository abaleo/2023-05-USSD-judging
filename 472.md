# No slippage control in `mintForToken()` function

## Summary
The function `mintForToken()` does not have any slippage control.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `mintForToken()` does not have any slippage control. If the price retrieved by the oracle is manipulated, this can result in loss for the user as they would receive a very low amount of stablecoins in return for the provided `tokenAmount`. There is a chance of 100% slippage.

## Impact
Loss for the user as they would receive a very low amount of stable coins in return for the provided `tokenAmount`. There is a chance of 100% slippage.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L151-L166

```solidity
   function mintForToken(
        address token,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address to
    ) public returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) { 
        require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token");

        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            tokenAmount
        );
        stableCoinAmount = calculateMint(token, tokenAmount);
        _mint(to, stableCoinAmount);

        emit Mint(msg.sender, to, token, tokenAmount, stableCoinAmount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a `uint amountOut` parameter to the function mintForToken() which lets user provide the least Amount of Stable Coin they would accept for the provided `tokenAmount`. Then proceed with mint only if `stableCoinAmount > amountOut `
