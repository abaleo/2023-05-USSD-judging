# `ethOracle` field initialized with zero address

## Summary

The `ethOracle` field inside of the `StableOracleDAI` is initialized with the zero address in the constructor.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since `ethOracle` is assigned the zero address, it will always revert when an attempt to call any of its functions is made. This means that the `StableOracleDAI::getPriceUSD` function will always revert since it calls `getPriceUSD` on `ethOracle` internally. This in turn will render the whole contract unusable.

## Impact

The `getPriceUSD` function of the `StableOracleDAI` contract will always revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the `ethOracle` hard-coded address to an appropriate one.
