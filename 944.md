# getSupplyProportion() is not suited for uniswap V3 - could lead to a DOS

## Summary

In UniV3, tokens can be in the pool but out of range. These tokens shouldn't be accounted for in the `rebalance()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is possible to add single side token liquidity in uniswapV3 (at inflated price for exemple). 
```solidity
    /// @dev return pool balances with USSD first
    function getSupplyProportion() public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
      uint256 vol1 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token0()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));
      uint256 vol2 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token1()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));
      if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        return (vol1, vol2);
      }
      return (vol2, vol1);
    }
```

The `getSupplyProportion()` returns the number of DAI and USSD tokens in the pool (not necessarily in range) in order to compute the number of token to buy/sell in the `rebalance()` function.


If an attacker supply a high number of tokens out of range the following lines might always revert (underflow)

## Impact

It would be impossible for the protocol to call the `rebalance()` function.

## Recommendation

The protocol shouldn't account for out-of-range liquidity
