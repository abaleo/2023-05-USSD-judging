# Oracle Data Feed Can Be Outdated Yet Used Anyways Which Will Impact Ussd Mints

## Summary

The price feed is used in the contracts StableOracleDAI , StableOracleWETH , StableOracleWBTC and helps retrieve the USD values
for DAI, WETH and WBTC. The logic uses latestRoundData() to fetch these prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink classifies their data feeds into four different groups regarding how reliable is each source thus, how risky they are. The groups are Verified Feeds, Monitored Feeds, Custom Feeds and Specialized Feeds (they can be seen [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/selecting-data-feeds/#data-feed-categories)). The risk is the lowest on the first one and highest on the last one.

A strong reliance on the price feeds has to be also monitored as recommended on the [Risk Mitigation section](https://docs.chain.link/docs/selecting-data-feeds/#risk-mitigation). There are several reasons why a data feed may fail such as unforeseen market events, volatile market conditions, degraded performance of infrastructure, chains, or networks, upstream data providers outage, malicious activities from third parties among others.

Chainlink recommends using their data feeds along with some controls to prevent mismatches with the retrieved data. Along some recommendations, the feed can include circuit breakers (for extreme price events), contract update delays (to ensure that the injected data into the protocol is fresh enough), manual kill-switches (to cease connection in case of found bug or vulnerability in an upstream contract), monitoring (control the deviation of the data) and soak testing (of the price feeds).

In USSD only the answer/price is used , which can be outdated  because no timestamp tolerance of the update source time is checked while storing the return parameters of latestRoundData() .

## Impact

This will effects the results of `calculateMint` here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L171 and `collateralFactor()` here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L189 , wrong amount of USSD would be minted + wrong collateral factor would be calculated

## Recommendation

Correctly adhere to the chainlink documentation and ensure you check every parameter returned by the latestRoundData()
