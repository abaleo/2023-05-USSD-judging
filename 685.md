# Incorrect static oracle used for `StableOracleWBGL` and `StableOracleDAI`

## Summary
The `StableOracleWBGL` contract incorrectly sets the state variable `staticOracleUniV3` during construction to the `WETH/WBGL` Uniswap v3 pool address, rather than the actual [static oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB210CE856631EeEB767eFa666EC7C1C57738d438#code). The same issue is present in `StableOracleDAI` where it is also incorrectly set as the `WETH/WBGL` pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
Given that the `staticOracleUniV3` state variable is incorrectly set to the `WETH/WBGL` pool address rather than the correct static oracle address, and the `UniswapV3Pool` contract has no fallback function, calls to `IStaticOracle::quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` within `StableOracleWBGL` will revert. Additionally, given there is no admin function to modify this state variable, the collateral would have to be removed from `USSD` prior to re-adding with the a newly deployed oracle contract.

## Impact
Use of `WBGL` as collateral will not be possible until a newly deployed oracle contract is associated with this collateral entry; however it does appear possible to recover from this and so the severity is limited.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the contract to use the correct static oracle address: `0xB210CE856631EeEB767eFa666EC7C1C57738d438`.
