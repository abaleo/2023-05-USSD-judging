# `StableOracleDAI::getPriceUSD` will revert due to zero address `ethOracle`

## Summary
The `ethOracle` state variable is currently set to the zero address with a `TODO` comment to update it to the `WETH` oracle. Given that it has not been updated, calls to the zero address with fail, causing transactions to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `ethOracle.getPriceUSD` is called within `StableOracleDAI::getPriceUSD`, the whole transaction will revert as it is not possible to call this function on the zero address. Therefore, the system will not be in a usable state until this is resolved.

## Impact
The system will not be in a usable state until this issue is resolved. If deployed as-is and added as the DAI collateral oracle, the collateral entry will need to be removed and re-added with a newly deployed `StableOracleDAI` contract which correctly references the `ethOracle`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Resolve the `TODO` comment by either hardcoding the `ethOracle` address or passing as a constructor argument as in `StableOracleWBGL`.
