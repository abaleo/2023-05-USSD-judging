# Anyone can burn tokens for USSD address

## Summary
Anyone can call `USSD.burnRebalancer`, which burns tokens that are minted by USSD contract itself.

## Vulnerability Detail
`USSD` contract `burnRebalancer` function burns tokens on behalf of USSD contract itself. The major issue is that anyone can call this function and affect the total supply, which directly affects the collateral factor.
```solidity
    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override  { // @audit - Anyone can burn
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```

## Impact
Tokens can be burned on behalf of USSD contract by anyone and affect the collateral factor.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override  {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the function is only meant to be called by rebalancer contract, add `onlyBalancer` modifier to the function
```solidity
    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer  {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
