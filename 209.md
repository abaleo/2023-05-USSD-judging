# rebalance process could process with wrong amount of `DAItosell` in certain scenario

## Summary

rebalance proceed using wrong amount of `DAItosell` incase of DAI asset is not in the first index. Causing rebalance not work properly.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside `rebalance()` call, if `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` is triggered, it will try to sell the current collateral to `baseAsset`. Incase of DAI collateral, it will not be swapped and directly set `DAItosell` value with following calculation : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L127

```solidity
            // no need to swap DAI
            DAItosell = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * amountToBuyLeftUSD / collateralval;
```
Instead of increase the value, it change the `DAItosell` with the calculation, overwriting the previous `DAItosell` calculation from previous collateral.

## Impact

It is stated in whitepaper that DAI is in the top priority of collateral list and will be at first index. However, inside `USSD` contract, it is possible for the control admin to change the index of the collateral : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L110-L118

```solidity
    function swapCollateralIndexes(
        uint256 _index1,
        uint256 _index2
    ) public onlyControl {
        // cannot use (a, b) = (b, a) for storage variables
        CollateralInfo memory tmp = collateral[_index1];
        collateral[_index1] = collateral[_index2];
        collateral[_index2] = tmp;
    }
```
So, it is not impossible for DAI index to be changed. and once it done, the rebalance process will use wrong  `DAItosell` when dealing with DAI collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the operation with increment : 

```solidity
            // no need to swap DAI
            DAItosell += IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * amountToBuyLeftUSD / collateralval;
```
