# Anyone can take over the control of the USSD and USSDRebalancer implemention contract

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Both of USSD's core contracts (USSD, USSDRebalancer) are upgradeable through a transparent proxy.
However, USSD fails to add `_disableInitializers` inside the implementation contract, allowing anyone to initiate the implementation contract and take over the control.
Openzepplin docs also recommend the same.

It's not highly severe, since a transparent proxy pattern on its own does not allow attackers to self-destruct like UUPS, however, it can cause unnecessary confusion to token holders regarding the correct address of the token.
Users can mint incorrect USSD tokens using the implementation contract directly and lose their collateral. 

## Impact
If anyone takes over the control of the USSD and USSDRebalancer implementation contract and starts minting and burning tokens, it affects the USSD protocol's legitimacy and brand value.
Some users can even lose their collateral to attackers if they use the implementation contract directly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding `_disableInitializers()` inside initialize for both of the contracts.
