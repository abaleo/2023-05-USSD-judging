# Admin can RUG all collateral assets in a not obvious sneaky way #1

## Summary
The contract contains numerous backdoors that allow the administrator to manipulate the protocol. Although the contest description states that the administrator is trustworthy and that such issues are invalid, it contradicts the project's whitepaper, which promotes a trustless and decentralized stablecoinâ€”something that is clearly not the case here.

The administrator can exploit the protocol to steal user funds in multiple methods. While I chose not to report the more evident vulnerabilities, I believe it is important to highlight and report this particular issue due to its subtle nature, as it may likely evade detection.

## Vulnerability Detail
The admin can silently and sneakily steal all the collateral tokens in the USDD.sol contract by doing 3 simple steps:
1. Call the `setUniswapRouter` function, and provide his EOA account / malicious contract as the `_router` parameter.
2. Call the `approveToRouter` will all the tokens which exist in the smart contract which will approve his malicious address to spend an unlimited amount of tokens on behalf of the `USDD.sol` contract
3. From his malicious EOA account/contract - Execute for each token the `transferFrom` function in order to steall all the tokens from the `USDD.sol` contract.

## Impact
All protocol collateral assets can be stolen

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Instead of granting unlimited spending authorization to the Router contract, approve only the specific tokens required for each individual swap during the rebalancing process. This approach ensures that the approval is limited to the necessary scope, mitigating potential risks.

2. Consider either removing the `setUniswapRouter` function altogether or providing a comprehensive explanation justifying its essential role within the system. This clarification will help stakeholders understand why the preservation of this function is crucial to the overall functionality and integrity of the protocol.
