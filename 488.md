# No Redemption possible, even if Whitepater stated it

## Summary

The Whitepaper states `If there is positive DAI balance in the collateral, USSD contract can provide
DAI for equal amount of USSD in return (that would be burned, contracting
supply).`, but in the contract code there is no possibility to actually redeem any USSD.

## Vulnerability Detail

Contract is deviating from the Whitepaper. In the `addCollateral` function and in the `CollateralInfo` struct there is a flag for `redeemable`, similiar to the `mintable` flag, which is used for DAI to allow minting of USSD by depositing DAI.
However, there is no function to actually redeem DAI for burning USSD, nor any other use of this flag.

## Impact

Contract is not working as by the user expected and in the whitepaper stated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a function to redeem DAI for USSD similiar to the `mintForToken` function.
