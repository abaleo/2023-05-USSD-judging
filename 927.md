# When invoking SellUSSDBuyCollateral, if CollateralList is being edited, the function may exit without achieving its objective.

## Summary
`IUSSD(USSD).collateralList()` may cause the list to be temporarily empty because elements can be deleted by the administrator.
In that case, the process of using the list in `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` is skipped, and the function ends with the process halfway through.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`, there is a process that loops through the collateral array as `for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++)`.
However, if the array is empty, this process is skipped.
In this process, DAI should be swapped to the collateral, but it is not executed and only DAI remains in the contract.
## Impact
The objective of the `BuyCollateral` part of `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` cannot be achieved. Unable to maintain the portfolio of collateral that was anticipated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the array is zero, the function cannot be invoked or the array cannot be edited to zero
