# Poor WBGL market liquidity makes the protocol vulnerable to price manipulation attack

## Summary

Poor WBGL market liquidity(around 6 WETH) makes the protocol vulnerable to price manipulation attack. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The attacker can easily push the WBGL/WETH price to a very high value with few ETH. Although the protocol uses the TWAP price oracle, this does not stop the price manipulation. The token has only 25 holders. Maintaining the high price for 10 minutes is easy.

## Impact

The attacker can use price manipulation attack to steal the protocol.
