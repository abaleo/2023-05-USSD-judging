# No slippage parameter has been passed for "UniV3SwapInput" function

## Summary
Swapping through UniV3SwapInput  can lead to frontrunning and loss of funds for the user as there is no slippage protection involved.
## Vulnerability Detail
The swap is defined as :
```solidity
  function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
Here we can see the `amountOutMinimum` is set to 0. This tells the swap that the `balancer contract` will accept a minimum amount of 0 output tokens from the swap,
## Impact
No slippagfe protection opens up to o a catastrophic loss of funds via [MEV bot sandwich attacks](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-sandwich-attack-explain-776f6f43b2fd).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pass a `minTokensOut` parameter in `UniV3SwapInput` , which is to be inputed from USSDBalancer contract.
And adding check for returned value of `exactInput`:
```solidity
require(uniRouter.exactInput(params) > minTokensOut , "High Slippage");
```
