# `USSD.sol#mintForToken` has no upper limit

## Summary

The `mintForToken` function has no mint upper limit. To much mint leads to a decrease in the collateral rate of the collateral and increases the risk

## Vulnerability Detail

USSD uses overcollateralization to ensure the stability of USSD. But the `mintForToken` function uses the value of the collateral 1:1 for the user mint USSD. This will result in a lower collateral rate for USSD and increases the risk.

## Impact

To much mint leads to a decrease in the collateral rate of the collateral and increases the risk
