# Missing `onlyBalancer` modifier on `USSD::mintRebalancer` and `USSD::mintRebalancer` puts the entire system at risk

## Summary
The `onlyBalancer` modifier is intended to allow only the `USSDRebalancer` contract to mint and burn tokens when rebalancing; however, `USSD::mintRebalancer` and `USSD::mintRebalancer` are missing this modifier and so anyone is able to arbitrarily call these functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `onlyBalancer` modifier is intended to allow only the `USSDRebalancer` contract to mint and burn tokens when rebalancing; however, `USSD::mintRebalancer` and `USSD::mintRebalancer` are missing this modifier and so anyone is able to arbitrarily call these functions. This puts the entire system at risk as any number of tokens can be minted/burned from the `USSD` contract, completely undermining collateral backing and rebalancing logic in `USSDRebalancer`.

## Impact
Callers can arbitrarily mint/burn tokens to/from the `USSD` contract, potentially leading to unbacked USSD or collateral being sold off if called in conjunction with triggering a rebalance.

```solidity
function rebalance() override public {
      uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation();
      (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
      if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
        // peg-down recovery
        BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
      } else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
        // mint and buy collateral
        // never sell too much USSD for DAI so it 'overshoots' (becomes more in quantity than DAI on the pool)
        // otherwise could be arbitraged through mint/redeem
        // the execution difference due to fee should be taken into accounting too
        // take 1% safety margin (estimated as 2 x 0.5% fee)
        IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100); // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
        SellUSSDBuyCollateral();
      }
    }
```

If chained with the Uniswap v3 pool token balance exploit #9 which allows the attacker to manipulate the return value of `USSDRebalancer:: getSupplyProportion` then execution of `USSD::rebalance` could be forced to enter either code path, giving the attacker another vector through which to profit at the expense of the protocol and its users.

## Recommendation
Add the `onlyBalancer` modifier to the `USSD::mintRebalancer` and `USSD::burnRebalancer` functions.
