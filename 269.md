# Chainlink's latestRoundData() is not sufficiently validated and therefore can lead to stale or incorrect results

## Summary

The project uses Chainlink data feeds to get up-to-date price information for tokens (DAI, wETH, wBTC).

There are certain checks that need to be made after receiving a Chainlink data feed result. These checks are missing which may lead to incorrect or stale price information used in the USSD protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

This issue affects the following 3 contracts which each call the `latestRoundData()` function of the Chainlink `AggregatorV3Interface` to retrieve the last answer available in the respective Chainlink data feed:

1. DatableOracleDai.sol: https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L48
2. DatableOracleWETH.sol: https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol#L23
3. StableOracleWBTC.sol: https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L23

After the `latestRoundData()` function is called the result may be stale or incorrect. Therefore **Chainlink specifically hints** at the required checks that need to be implemented. Check https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds.

Affected are all places in the code of the USSD protocol where the `getPriceUSD()` function of the mentioned contracts is called. 

The following calculations are therefore susceptible to the missing checks when interacting with the Chainlink data feed.

1. Calculation of how much USSD is minted for a user in exchange for supplied collateral: https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol
2. Calculation of the USSD collateral factor: https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L179
3. Buying USSD and selling collateral during rebalancing: https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L116

## Impact

Price can be stale or incorrect and can lead to wrong tokens prices and related calculations in the USSD protocol.

The severity should be set to "medium" since it is not a straightforward attack because of the external dependence on a Chainlink data feed returning heavily wrong data or malfunctioning.

Nevertheless due to the direct exposure of the USSD mint logic to the issue in the `mintForToken` function (https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#LL151C14-L151C26) the severity was chosen to be "high".

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the logic to interact with Chainlink data feeds in the 3 contracts with the required checks.

Here we use the example of the `StableOracleDAI.sol` contract.

```solidity
(uint80 roundId, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();

// check for stale Oracle price
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Oracle price is stale");

// check for round completeness
require(updatedAt != 0, "Round not complete");

// check that Oracle price is positive (data type is int and not uint!)
require(price > 0, "Oracle price is negative");

// check that the price is within bounds assumed healthy/correct
// NOTE: the _maxPrice and _minPrice are not included here
require(price < \_maxPrice, "Upper price bound breached");
require(price > \_minPrice, "Lower price bound breached");

return
  (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
  ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);

```
