# Incorrect Calculation of `daibought` in `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` Function


## Summary

In the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function of the `USSDRebalancer` contract, there is a bug where the calculation of the `daibought` variable is incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

## Vulnerability Detail

The bug occurs in the following code snippet:

```solidity
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount);
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
      } else {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token1(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token0())), amount);
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
```

I beleive the intention of this code is to calculate the amount of the base asset (`baseAsset`) bought during the swap operation. However, due to the incorrect usage of the `daibought` variable, the result is always 0. This is because the calculation subtracts the same value from itself, resulting in no change.

## Impact

The incorrect calculation of `daibought` prevents the accurate determination of the amount of the base asset bought during the swap operation. As a result, any subsequent operations or decisions based on this value may produce unexpected or incorrect results. This bug could potentially impact the rebalancing mechanism and the overall functioning of the contract.

## Code Snippet

The affected code snippet is shown below:
[SellUSSDBuyCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L163-L175)

```solidity
    function SellUSSDBuyCollateral() internal {
      uint256 amount = IUSSD(USSD).balanceOf(USSD);
      // sell for DAI then swap by DAI routes
      uint256 daibought = 0;
      if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount);
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
      } else {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token1(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token0())), amount);
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
      }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this bug, the calculation of `daibought` should be corrected. Instead of subtracting the initial balance of the base asset from itself, it should be subtracted from the updated balance after the swap operation.
