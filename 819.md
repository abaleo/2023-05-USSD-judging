# DAI to sell would be calculated way more if there is no path to sell (no swaps)

## Summary

This line https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L127 misses a division by 1e18 which would result in very high value for DAI to
sell.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's compare L121 by L127 since they are calculating basically the same thing.

L121 here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L121 calculates as 

`IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18)`

and L127 calculates the DAI to sell as 

`DAItosell = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * amountToBuyLeftUSD / collateralval;`

Mathematically comparing  , we can see L127 is missing a division by 1e18 and this would make the DAI to sell value
in situations where there would be no swap very high thus making the pool undercollateralized.


## Impact

Veri high value for DAI to sell , alot more DAI would be sold than required making the pool undercollateralized and 
making USSD lose it's peg.
