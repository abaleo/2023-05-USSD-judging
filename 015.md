## Summary
Without a `deadline parameter`, the transaction may sit in the `mempool` and be executed at a much later time potentially resulting in an `unfavorable/Worst price` .
## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is in the  `USSD ` contract at the  `UniV3SwapInput ` function.
   ```solidity
   function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,  // @audit block.timestamp is set to zero by default making the transaction be executed later at more unfavorable time
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                @audit the slippage is set to zero, meaning users can
                accrue a loss by getting zero amount of tokens from the swap
                amountOutMinimum: 0 //@audit no slippage, can receive 0 output tokens
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
In the `UniV3SwapInput` function, the params struct is created with the `deadline` parameter `commented out`. This means that the deadline value is not provided explicitly when calling the `exactInput` function.

The impact of not providing a specific `deadline` value depends on the implementation of the `exactInput` function in the `uniRouter` contract. Some possible scenarios include:

If the `exactInput` function has a default or `fallback` value for the deadline parameter, it would use that default value when no explicit `deadline` is provided. In this case, 
If the exactInput function requires a `deadline` parameter and does not have a fallback/default value, omitting the `deadline` in the params struct would likely result in a revert of the transaction. 
It's worth noting that using a `zero deadline` can have security implications, as it removes the protection against potential `front-running` or delayed execution attacks. Without a `deadline`, the transaction could be executed at an `unfavorable price` or be subject to manipulation if there are volatile market conditions.
Also `Protocols` shouldn't set the `deadline` to `block.timestamp` as a validator can hold the transaction and the block it is eventually put into will be `block.timestamp`, so this offers no protection. should allow users interacting with AMMs to set `expiration deadlines`; no expiration deadline may create a potential `critical` loss of funds vulnerability for any user initiating a swap, especially if there is also no `slippage parameter`.

**Expliot Scenario**
If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades:
this issue can be maliciously exploited is through `MEV`:

A `swap` transaction`(STABLE/ETH)` is still pending in the `mempool`. Average fees are still too high for miners to be interested in it. The price of `ETH` has gone down significantly since the transaction was signed, meaning the user would receive a lot more `ETH` when the `swap` is executed. But that also means that the user `amountOutMinimum` would allow for significant `slippage`.
A `MEV` bot detects the pending transaction. Since the outdated `amountOutMinimum` allows for high slippage, the bot `sandwiches` the user, resulting in significant profit for the bot and significant loss for the user.

## Impact
This combination of No `Slippage` & No `Deadline` exposes the user to the potential loss of all their input `tokens`.

## Tool used

`Manual Review`

## Recommendation
The most common solution is to include a `deadline` `timestamp` as a parameter instead of commenting it out, The Devs should Add an `Argument` where a reasonable `deadline` can be put as a preferred expiration `deadline` for their `transactions`.
