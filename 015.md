# Missing deadline checks allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed

## Summary
Without a deadline parameter, the transaction may sit in the mempool and be executed at a much later time potentially resulting in a worse price for the user
## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is in the  `USSD ` contract at the  `UniV3SwapInput ` function.
   ```solidity
   function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,  // @audit block.timestamp is set to zero by default making the transaction be executed later at more unfavorable time
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                @audit the slippage is set to zero, meaning users can
                accrue a loss by getting zero amount of tokens from the swap
                amountOutMinimum: 0 //@audit no slippage, can receive 0 output tokens
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
Protocols shouldn't set the deadline to block.timestamp as a validator can hold the transaction and the block it is eventually put into will be block.timestamp, so this offers no protection. And protocols should allow users interacting with AMMs to set expiration deadlines; no expiration deadline may create a potential critical loss of funds vulnerability for any user initiating a swap, especially if there is also no slippage parameter.

**Expliot Scenario**
If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades:
this issue can be maliciously exploited is through MEV:

A swap transaction(STABLE/ETH) is still pending in the mempool. Average fees are still too high for miners to be interested in it. The price of ETH has gone down significantly since the transaction was signed, meaning the user would receive a lot more ETH when the swap is executed. But that also means that the user amountOutMinimum would allow for significant slippage.
A MEV bot detects the pending transaction. Since the outdated amountOutMinimum allows for high slippage, the bot sandwiches the user, resulting in significant profit for the bot and significant loss for the user.

## Impact
This combination of No Slippage & No Deadline exposes the user to the potential loss of all their input tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter, The Devs should Add an Argument for which users can input their preferred expiration deadline for their transactions.
