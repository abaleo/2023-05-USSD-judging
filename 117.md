# StableOracleWBTC uses  eth price feed.

## Summary
`StableOracleWBTC` uses the wrong price feed. which will return a drasticlly different price which will lead to users loosing funds when attempting to mint. Along with using the wrong values when performing calculations inside of `rebalance()`.

Note: this is also true for DAI and WBGL. Both contract are using WGBL address. Because the mistake and the fix are the same I consider this 1 single issue.  (But can be persuaded) 
## Vulnerability Detail
The price feed used in the contract is: `0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419`

as seen here: 

```solidity
contract StableOracleWBTC is IStableOracle {
    AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed;

    constructor() {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419
        );
    }

    function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD
        return uint256(price) * 1e10;
    }
}
```

If you search this contract address the first thing you will see is a link to etherscan stating that this address belongs to the eth/usd instead of WBTC

## Impact
The price returned will be drasticllaly differnt than expected and users will loose funds when they interact with this price feed.
