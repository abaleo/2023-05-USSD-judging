# getOwnValuation uses spot price and not the twap

## Summary
The `getOwnValuation` uses the spotprice of the uniswap token and not the twap price.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `getOwnValuation` gets the price of USSD according to the price of the USSD/DAI pool. However it uses the spotprice like this:
```solidity
      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
```
It does some more calculations to get the price as USSD/DAI. 
The `getOwnValuation` function is called in `rebalance` and `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`. Depending on the output rebalance will either buy or sell USSD.
This makes it possible for anyone to flashloan and influence the output of `getOwnValuation` and call rebalance. The protocol will now buy or sell USSD when it's not warranted, bringing it in a unstable state.
## Impact
Anyone can make the protocol buy or sell `USSD` by executing a flashloan. 
## Code Snippet
[Link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L71)

```solidity
function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
      if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
      } else {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
        // flip the fraction
        price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
      }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the TWAP price and don't use spot price as it's easy to manipulate.
