# Incorrect Oracle Address Assignment in StableOracleDAI Contract Constructor

## Summary

The StableOracleDAI incorrectly assigns a WETH/WBG UniswapV3Pool address as a  StaticOracle address.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the constructor of the StableOracleDAI contract, it's noticed that a [WETH/WBG UniswapV3Pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e#code) address (0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e) is used to create an IStaticOracle instance named DAIEthOracle.

```solidity
        DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e
        );
```
also in StableOracleWBGL
```solidity
        staticOracleUniV3 = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e
        );
```

 If a Uniswap V3 Pool contract is present at this address, it will not have those methods, leading to the contract failing when calling them.

## Impact

A failure to correctly instantiate the DAIEthOracle instance with the correct contract address would render the getPriceUSD function of this contract non-functional. This is because the getPriceUSD function is reliant on the quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod function of the DAIEthOracle. If the address provided doesn't have this function, it could cause transaction reverts when this function is called, potentially causing the entire StableOracleDAI contract to fail.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Please ensure that the contract address provided in the constructor for DAIEthOracle matches the address of a deployed IStaticOracle contract
