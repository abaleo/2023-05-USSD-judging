# Incorrect Address in StableOracleWBTC Contract Results in Wrong priceFeed

## Summary

In StableOracleWBTC  contract The constructor is incorrectly configured with the [ETH/USD](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) price feed address, instead of the intended BTC/USD price feed address. This results in incorrect price information being returned by the getPriceUSD() function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The StableOracleWBTC contract imports and uses the AggregatorV3Interface from the Chainlink contracts. In the constructor of this contract, the address of the price feed oracle is set to 0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419, which is the address for the Chainlink ETH/USD price feed, instead of 0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c, the Chainlink BTC/USD price feed. This means that any call to getPriceUSD() will return the price of ETH instead of BTC.

```solidity
    constructor() {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419  // ETH/USD pricefeed address
        );
    }
```

## Impact

The contract is supposed to provide the price of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), but instead gives the price of Ethereum.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract address in the constructor should be updated to the correct Chainlink BTC/USD price feed address
```solidity
    constructor() {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c
        );
```
