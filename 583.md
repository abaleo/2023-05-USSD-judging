# Insufficient Access Control on mintRebalancer and burnRebalancer Functions

## Summary

The USSD smart contract's mintRebalancer and burnRebalancer functions are currently exposed as public functions. This allows any external actor to call these functions and potentially mint or burn tokens arbitrarily.

## Vulnerability Detail

The mintRebalancer and burnRebalancer functions in the USSD contract are declared as public, which means they can be invoked by any external entity. These functions mint and burn tokens respectively without any access controls. Ideally, these functions should only be accessible to the rebalancer contract.

## Impact

Without proper access control, any external actor could mint an arbitrary number of tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
it is recommended to add an access control modifier such as onlyBalancer on the mintRebalancer and burnRebalancer functions.
```solidity
function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public onlyBalancer override {
    _mint(address(this), amount);
}

function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public onlyBalancer override {
    _burn(address(this), amount);
}

```
