# Change in base asset is not considered for rebalance calculations

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
USSD has a provision to change base assets later to a different ERC20 token.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L66-L68

To accommodate this possibility, USSD takes care of not assuming the base asset as token 0 or token 1 throughout the rebalancer.
However, USSD fails to consider changes in decimals from DAI(18) to newer base assets.
Some calculations done inside rebalance, would only work for ``baseAsset.decimals() = 18`` and miscalculate for other decimals.

For example:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L92-L97
If the base asset is changed to some different token with different decimals from DAI, the DAIAmount needs to be divided by ``(10 ** (new decimals - 6))``, instead of 10 ** 12 always.
For the most probable case of decimals < 18, this would undervalue the dai amount to be sold always, and thereby peg won't return to 1e6 as intended.

## Impact
Rebalance would become dysfunctional if base asset with different decimals is assigned later

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either remove the ability to change the baseAsset or refractor the calculations to accommodate decimals change.
