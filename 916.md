# ethOracle in some of the contracts wont work

## Summary
because the `ethOracle` oracle is initialized to address(0) the oracle wont be able to work 
## Vulnerability Detail
It will cause daiOracle to revert because address(0)can't run code with the interface
## Impact
It will cause dai oracle not to work and be a waste of deployment and possibly cause the whole protocol to brake since it's so based on Dai
This oracle is the main oracle of the system and here the code breaks and the desired functionality won't work forever.Causing waste of gas cost for redeployment/tx reverting. 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000);
```
