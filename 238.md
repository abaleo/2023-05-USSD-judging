# Insecure use of approval

## Summary

The Function of the contract may not be given if there are approvals missing. 
The contract is designed in a way where it relies on manually granted approvals by the admin (or anybody else).

Also, infinite approval for any token to the unsiswap router contract can be done by everyone.
In general it is not recommend to approve an infinite ammount of tokens to any contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [USSD.sol:242-246](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L242-246) the `approveToRouter` function is public and is giving an infinite approval for a caller specified to the stored `uniRouter` address. 
The `rebalance` function of the `USSDRebalancer`, which itself calls the `UniV3SwapInput` function in USSD.sol relies on this to be called beforehand for the collateral tokens. If the approval is not given the Swap will not work and the rebalance function will revert.

Additionaly it is in general not recommended to give an infinite approval to another contract, but only give the required approval for the action, and revoke any unnecessary approvals afterwards.
In this specific case it is even worse, as everybody can call the functions and give approvals.

## Impact

- If there is an approval missing for a collateral Token, the `rebalance` function will revert
- In case there is a vulnerability in the contract stored in `uniRouter` all Funds of the contract are at risk

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Do not maintain approvals in a separate function, but give approvals, only for the required amount when needed (e.g. in `UniV3SwapInput`)
- Do not allow everyone to call the approval function for an arbitrary token.
