# Unnecessary multiplication by 10 in `getPriceUSD90` function can lead to incorrect price calculation

## Summary
The getPriceUSD function in the provided code contains an unnecessary multiplication by 10, which can result in incorrect price calculation. This can lead to inaccurate pricing information and potentially impact the functionality of the system relying on this function.
## Vulnerability Detail
This `StableOracleDAI.getPriceUSD()` function retrieves the price of a specific token in USD. It utilizes the DAIEthOracle contract to calculate the DAI/WETH price based on a specific time period and the corresponding Uniswap V3 pool.  The `DAIWethPrice` 
represents with 18 decimal places.
https://etherscan.io/address/0xb210ce856631eeeb767efa666ec7c1c57738d438/advanced#readContract
```solidity
    uint256 DAIWethPrice = DAIEthOracle.quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
            1000000000000000000, // 1 Eth
            0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2, // WETH (base token)
            0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F, // DAI (quote token)
            pools, // DAI/WETH pool uni v3
            600 // period
        );
```
Additionally, it retrieves the current USD price of WETH from the ethOracle contract. The function then fetches the latest price data for DAI/ETH from the priceFeedDAIETH contract.  The `price ` represents with 18 decimal places.

```solidity
  (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```

Finally, it calculates and returns the USD price of the token based on the obtained prices. 
There is an unnecessary multiplication by 10 in the expression (DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10). Both DAIWethPrice and price are already represented with 18 decimal places, so multiplying price by 10 would result in an inaccurate calculation.
```solidity
      return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```
## Impact
 The returned price value from the function may be significantly higher than the actual intended value. This can have detrimental effects on any subsequent operations or decisions that rely on the accurate price information.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, remove the multiplication by 10 from the expression. The corrected expression should be (DAIWethPrice + uint256(price)). This ensures that the calculation accurately reflects the sum of DAIWethPrice and price without introducing any additional scaling.
