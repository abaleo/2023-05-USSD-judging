# Attacker can manipulate the return value of USSDRebalancer.getOwnValuation for profit

## Summary

Anyone can call `USSDRebalancer.rebalance`. The execution path of `USSDRebalancer.rebalance` depends on the return value of `USSDRebalancer.getOwnValuation`. By flash loan, attacker pumps the price of collateral, and affects the return value of `USSDRebalancer.getOwnValuation`, then makes profit.

## Vulnerability Detail

`getOwnValuation` uses `sqrtPriceX96` returned by `uniPool.slot0()` to calculate own value. Below I will call it `value`.

```solidity
function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
      if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
      } else {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
        // flip the fraction
        price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
      }
    }
```

`sqrtPriceX96` can be manipulated to affect `value` returned by `getOwnValuation`.

Bob deploys an attack contract A. **The whole attack is completed in one tx**, the process is as follows:

1.  A initiates a flash loan to borrow a certain amount of DAI, which is divided into two parts, one part is used to affect uniPool (UUSD-DAI), and the other part is used to buy various collateral tokens.
    
2.  A calls `uniRouter.exactInput` to buy UUSD in uniPool, so as to achieve the goal of `value > 1e6 + threshold`.
    
3.  A calls `uniRouter.exactInput` (once for each collateral) to buy the collateral token in the specified pool for each collateral. This will pump the price of the collateral.
    
4.  A calls `UUSD.mintRebalancer` to mint some amount of UUSD token for UUSD contract. This will make the return value of `USSD.collateralFactor` smaller. `USSD.collateralFactor` is used in [[SellUSSDBuyCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L178)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L178).
    
5.  A calls `USSDRebalancer.rebalance`, and the flow enters `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` due to the operation of the second step. Internally, this function will swap all UUSD token in the UUSD contract to DAI, and then use all DAI to buy various collaterals. This will further pump the price of the collateral.
    
6.  A calls `uniRouter.exactInput` to sell all collateral tokens and UUSD for profit.
    
7.  A repays flash loan.
    

On the contrary, you can also trigger the execution of `BuyUSSSellCollateral` to make a profit.

## Impact

Attacker profits. The protocol suffers a funds loss.

## Recommendation

Use time-weighted prices, similar to the implementation in UniswapV3StaticOracle.sol.
