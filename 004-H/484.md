# `rebalance()` fails during `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` execution

## Summary

Whenever the `ownVal` of USSD which is determined by computing the price of the stable coin from the USSD/DAI UniswapV3 pool is greater than the set threshold on the protocol (i.e. it is higher than an upper limit - as example 1.02) invoking the `rebalance()` function would trigger the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` functionality which sole purpose is to `mint` a defined amount of USSD and sell it on the UniswapV3 pool in order to re-peg the USSD token. This functionality sells USSD for DAI initially and then uses the purchased DAI to convert to the other supported collaterals (i.e. WETH, WBTC, WBGL) based on pre-defined ratios using UniswapV3 pools.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since DAI is already purchased and is one of the supported collaterals the loop that goes through each collateral should skip it and swap DAI only for the other collateral types, however this is not the cause which causes the whole `rebalance()` transaction to fail due to attempted swap from DAI to DAI which does not exist. 

```solidity
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++) {
        uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;
        if (collateralval * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[i].ratios[flutter]) {
          if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {
            // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
          }
        }
      }
```

As we can see from the above snippet of code as commented DAI shouldn't be touched as it is already bought. However the issue arises from the second `if` statement `if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1())`. Since `||` is used one of those conditions will evaluate to `true` as `DAI != uniPool.token()` or `DAI != uniPool.token1()`, which would cause the execution to enter in the `if` and attempt to make a swap using a `0x` pathBuy causing the whole transaction to fail. The `pathBuy` is set to `0x` since the actual buy of DAI is executed earlier in the function call where the path is computed (reference: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L167-L175)


## Impact

The above mentioned vulnerability causes full block of the core `rebalance()` functionality of the protocol in the event of USSD price going up above a given threshold on UniswapV3 Pool.

Manual Review / Foundry

## Recommendation

Instead of `||` use `&&` which will make sure that neither of the two uniTokens is equal to the collateral.

Change:

```solidity
if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1())
```

To:

```solidity
if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() && collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1())
```
