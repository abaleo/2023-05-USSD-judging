# More DAI is brought than what is needed for the protocol

## Summary
Excessive buying of DAI is executed, leading to miscalculation of `collateral.ratios`.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the code given at `USSDRebalancer.sol::SellUSSDBuyCollateral`  : 
```solidity 
 if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {
            // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
          }
```
the comment says : `// don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)`, which means DAI is already brought and there  is no need to buy DAI again and a condition is set above the comment for the same . But the problem is, the condition provided in if statement is faulty. The provided condition checks if either of the `uniPool` token is not equal to the current collateral token , then the swap is performed. But we know one of the uniPool token is ``USSD`` and it is not part of collateral token. So the condition where- uniPool.token0()= ``USSD`` and  uniPool.token1()=``DAI``, the check will be bypassed to buy more ``DAI``(even though ``DAI`` has been already brought). 
## Impact
It leads to miscalculation of `collateral.ratios` and hence increasing the ratios of ``DAI`` in collateral to an unexpected level.

## Recommendation

Change the `if condition` to this : 
```solidity
 if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() && collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1())
```
