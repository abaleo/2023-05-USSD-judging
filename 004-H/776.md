# `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` would revert in case of ``collateralval(DAI) * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[DAI].ratios[flutter]`` due to incorrect check

## Summary
`SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` would revert due to an incorrect check (use of OR instead of AND)

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside SellUSSDBuyCollateral, USSD first swaps USSD into DAI, and later as per flutter rations and portions, swaps bought DAI into different collaterals.
For this swap of DAI into different collaterals, it is important that swap of DAI into DAI is skipped, since `collateral[i].pathbuy` in case of DAI is empty ("0x").

The USSD team also comments the same on L200, and has added a check on L199 to skip such swaps.

However, this check would always return true, no matter what, due to the use of OR instead of AND.

`if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) `

Hence rebalance would attempt to swap DAI using collateral[i].pathbuy as "" and revert on uniswap's side.

## Impact
USSD won't be able to get rebalanced forever, once the condition of ``collateralval(DAI) * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[DAI].ratios[flutter]`` occurs

## Recommendation
Consider using AND instead of OR for condition on L199
