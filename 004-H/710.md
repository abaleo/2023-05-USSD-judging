# Incorrect check in SellUSSDBuyCollateral function

## Summary

Incorrect check in `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

 `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function includes a check that should prevent buying DAI during it's execution:

```solidity
          if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) { 
            // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
          }
```
The `if` statement should check that the current collater token is not DAI (not one of the tokens in the pool). However it was wrongly implemented due to the `||` operator, so any token address would successfully go through it. 

## Impact

A portion of DAI tokens would be bought while it should not during buying collaterals in `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider updating `if` statement to: 

```solidity
    if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() && collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) 
```
