# The last if statement in `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function is broken according to the comments.

## Summary
The last if statement in `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function is broken and could mess the rebalancing process.
## Vulnerability Detail
The last if statement in `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`  should not use DAI to be bought since it was already been bought at the begging of the function, as the comments says https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L199-L201 but the way the if statement is written it will always pass, even on DAI because the if statement uses || operator and not && operator and since it checks for both tokens in the pool it will always be true for when it checks for USSD, since DAI address will be different than USSD address, buying DAI again.
## Impact
Selling DAI again can mess with the rebalancing process which can hurt the project.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the && operator instead of the || so it needs both of the statements to be true, for the if statement to pass.
