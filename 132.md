# Incorrectly calculation of the price in the StableOracleDAI Contract returns the price scaled up by an incorrect magnitude

## Summary
The math implemented to calculate the price of DAI on the `StableOracleDAI.sol` contract has errors when manipulating the magnitude of the prices, which causes the final price to not be scaled up by the expected magnitude of `10**18`

## Vulnerability Detail
Incorrectly handled the magnitudes of the different prices pulled from different oracles, the final price is not scaled up by `10**18` as it is expected.

- `wethPriceUSD` is expected to be scaled up by `10**18`, since it is an instance of the `IStableOracle` and uses the `getPriceUSD()`, which [states that the returned price is scaled up by `10**18`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IStableOracle.sol#L5)
- `DAIWethPrice` is an instance of the [`IStaticOracle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IStaticOracle.sol), which specifies the [`baseAmmount` to be 1eth](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L37), which is equivalent to be scaled up by `10**18` 
- The `price` variable which stores the [price returned by the DAI/ETH chainlink oracle is also scaled up by `10**18`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4#readContract#F3)

By doing the math, the final price will be scaled as follows ((`10**36`)/(`10**28`)), which is equal to `10**8`, instead of being scaled up by `10**18`.
  - **NOTE** => The returned price from this `StableOracleDAI` should be `10**18`, because the [Collaterals registers their Oracles as instances of the `IStableOracle` interface](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IUSSDRebalancer.sol#L17), thus, the [price returned by the `getPriceUSD()` is expected to be scaled up by `10**18`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IUSSDRebalancer.sol#L17)

## Impact
Calculations relying on the price returned by this oracle will be wrong which could lead to either users losing funds, or the protocols taking losses because of the usage of an incorrect price.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure to check the decimals that are returned from each Oracle contract, especially the Oracle Chainlink contracts, not all of them return 8 decimals.
Depending on the decimals make sure to scale up appropriately the different prices so that the final price is correctly scaled up by the expected `10**18` magnitude

- For this specific Oracle implementation, make sure to [remove the multiplication of the scale 1e10](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L52)
  - By removing that multiplication, the prices will now be scaled correctly:
    - ((`10**36`)/(`10**18`)) == `10**18`

The return should looks like:
```solidity
function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
    ...
    ...

    return
        (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
        ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price)) / 2);
}
```
