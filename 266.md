# XDZIBEC-Decimal Precision Mismatch in Collateral Value Comparison resulting in the loss or theft of funds.

## Summary

in the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral `function. The issue arises due to the incorrect comparison between `collateralval `and `amountToBuyLeftUSD` in the` if `statement condition.
The `collateralval `variable represents the value of a specific collateral in terms of `USD`. However, `amountToBuyLeftUSD` is expressed in `Wei` `(18 decimal precision)`, while` collateralval` is calculated with `18 decimal` precision. Comparing these two` values` can `lead` to `incorrect` results and` unintended behavior`.
 it is necessary to ensure that `amountToBuyLeftUSD` is converted to the same decimal precision as `collateralval` before the comparison. The specific fix will depend on the desired decimal precision and the range of values used in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

 ```solidity
   function BuyUSSDSellCollateral(uint256 amountToBuy) internal {
      CollateralInfo[] memory collateral = IUSSD(USSD).collateralList();
      //uint amountToBuyLeftUSD = amountToBuy * 1e12 * 1e6 / getOwnValuation();
      uint amountToBuyLeftUSD = amountToBuy * 1e12;
      uint DAItosell = 0;
      // Sell collateral in order of collateral array
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++) {
        uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;
        if (collateralval > amountToBuyLeftUSD) {
          // sell a portion of collateral and exit
          if (collateral[i].pathsell.length > 0) {
            uint256 amountBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
            uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, amountToSellUnits);
            amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
            DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
          } else {
            // no need to swap DAI
            DAItosell = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * amountToBuyLeftUSD / collateralval;
          }
          break;
        } else {
          // sell all or skip (if collateral is too little, 5% treshold)
          if (collateralval >= amountToBuyLeftUSD / 20) {
            uint256 amountBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
            // sell all collateral and move to next one
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD));
            amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
            DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
          }
        }
    }
```

The vulnerability in line of code pertains to a decimal precision mismatch in the comparison of `collateral` values. Specifically, the issue lies in the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function within the `USSDRebalance`r contract
So the function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` issue arises due to the incorrect comparison,  so the issues arises due to the improper use of the `collateralval `variable in the if statement condition cause the `collateralval` variable represents the value of a specific `collateral` in terms of `USD.` so the condition` collateralval > amountToBuyLeftUSD` is used to determine whether to sell a portion of the `collateral`, However, the comparison `collateralval > amountToBuyLeftUSD` is incorrect because `amountToBuyLeftUSD `is expressed in `Wei (18 decimals)`, while` collateralval` is calculated with `18 decimal` precision, comparing `collateralval `(with `18 decimal` precision) to `amountToBuyLeftUSD` (with `12 decimal `precision) can lead to incorrect results and unintended behavior so it's should ensure that `amountToBuyLeftUSD` is converted to the same decimal precision as `collateralval` before the comparison.

The contract calculates the `collateral` value ratio for each available collateral based on the current` collateral` `factor (cf)` and compares it with a predefined threshold value. However, the comparison is flawed due to inconsistent decimal precision between the collateral value and the threshold. Here's the vulnerable code snippet:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++) {
  uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;
  if (collateralval * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[i].ratios[flutter]) {
    // Vulnerable comparison
    portions++;
  }
}
```
The issue arises in the line `collateralval * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[i].ratios[flutter]`, where `collateralval` is multiplied by `1e18` to align the decimal precision with `ownval`. However, the division operation `collateralval * 1e18 / ownval` does not match the decimal precision of `collateral[i].ratios[flutter]`,potentially resulting in inaccurate comparison results.

## Impact

**Here is POC a Scenario for the Vulnerability:**
1-Attacker's Goal:
  -The attacker's objective is to manipulate the `rebalancing` process of the` USSD/DAI` pool to their advantage and potentially gain financial benefits.
2-Identifying the Vulnerability:
  -The attacker conducts a thorough analysis of the `USSDRebalance`r contract and identifies the decimal precision mismatch vulnerability in the calculations and comparisons involving collateral values and thresholds.
3-Pool Manipulation:
  -The attacker acquires a significant amount of` USSD` tokens and establishes control over a portion of the `USSD/DAI` pool's liquidity.
4-Exploitation Steps:
a. Calculating Threshold Manipulation:
  -The attacker carefully crafts transactions to manipulate the threshold calculation in their favor. They aim to deceive the contract into perceiving the pool valuation as being above or below the intended thresholds.
b. Decimal Precision Manipulation:
  -Leveraging the decimal precision mismatch vulnerability, the attacker skillfully manipulates the collateral value calculations in a way that introduces inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
c. Triggering Incorrect `Rebalancing` Actions:
  -By exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker manages to deceive the contract into initiating incorrect `rebalancing `actions.
    For instance, they may manipulate the collateral valuation to make it appear below the threshold, tricking the contract into selling     
    `USSD` for `collateral`.
  -Alternatively, they could manipulate the valuation to exceed the threshold, prompting the contract to mint `USSD` and buy 
   additional `collateral`.
5-Financial Gain:
  -Through the manipulated rebalancing actions, the attacker gains a financial advantage by buying or selling assets at opportune 
    moments.
  -They may profit from buying collateral at an artificially low price or selling `USSD` at an inflated value, taking advantage of the 
    discrepancy between the manipulated calculations and the actual market conditions.
6-Concealment and Repeating the Exploit:
  -To avoid detection and suspicion, the attacker carefully covers their tracks and repeats the exploit sporadically over time, accumulating financial gains without raising immediate red flags.

## Recommendation

- Ensure consistent and precise decimal operations throughout the contract. Use appropriate decimal libraries or fixed-point arithmetic to handle decimal calculations accurately. Avoid relying on integer conversions or approximations that may introduce rounding errors or imprecise results.
-  Maintain consistent decimal representations for values across different parts of the contract. Ensure that values are consistently scaled and converted to the appropriate decimal precision when performing comparisons or calculations. This helps to avoid inconsistencies and inaccuracies arising from differing decimal scales.
-  Consider integrating external oracles or price feeds to obtain accurate and up-to-date valuations of collateral assets. By relying on external sources for price information, you can ensure more reliable and precise comparisons during the rebalancing process.
- Perform thorough testing, including unit tests and scenario-based simulations, to verify the accuracy and functionality of the rebalancer module. Test various scenarios with different collateral values and ratios to ensure the rebalancing decisions are correct and aligned with the desired outcomes.
-  Conduct regular security audits by independent third-party experts to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the contract. Security audits can provide valuable insights and recommendations for improving the overall robustness and security of the system.
- mitigate the risks associated with the decimal precision mismatch vulnerability and enhance the accuracy, stability, and security of the `USSDRebalancer` contract.
