# StableOracleDAI does not work due to misconfigured addresses

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L28
## Vulnerability Detail
`DAIEthOracle` address is set to a Uniswapv3Pool instead of a deployed StaticOracle library. Thus, every call made will revert as the Uniswapv3Pool does not have a `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` method. 

**Note:** There is no way to set oracle addresses once deployed thus it cannot be changed once deployed.
## Impact
`StableOracleDAI` does not work.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the address of `DAIEthOracle` to an address of a deployed StaticOracle and add a function for changing oracle addresses.
