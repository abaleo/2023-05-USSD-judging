# Sandwitch attack will happen because no check on slippage

## Summary
Since amountOutMinimum 0 is saying we don't give us the token no matter the price/amount and since on Ethereum it will be moved and it can cause loss and dust in the protocol and an attacker can profit from rebalancing. Getting sandwiched is possible 
## Vulnerability Detail
A sandwich attack is possible with this and we can abuse it  and not get as much collateral back and the attacker  can call the rebalance and sandwich(buy contract->buy sell)

## Impact
Profit for the attacker and loss of collateral for the contract
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Compute the price and check with slippage or have the slippage amount computed  by the contract
