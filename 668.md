# The `getCollateralIndex()` does not return any value if the `_token` address is not found

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getCollateralIndex()` function does not have a return statement if the collateral token is not found in the collateral array. You should add a return statement outside the loop to handle this case.

```solidity
function getCollateralIndex(
        address _token
    ) public view returns (uint256 index) {
        for (index = 0; index < collateral.length; index++) {
            if (collateral[index].token == _token) {
                return index;
            }
        }
    }
```
## Impact
The `getCollateralIndex()` is used in the `calculateMint()` function which itself is further used in the `mintForToken()` function.

Even though the `mintForToken()` has following check to keep the functioning safe, the contract is created to be upgradable one, and ignoring this will cause issue down the road.

```solidity
require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make `getCollateralIndex()` send back a negative index which is checked if token truly exists as collateral or not.
