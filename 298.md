# Unchecked Approval Return Value in USSD Contract Means Approval of WBGL Could Fail Silently

## Summary

The return value of the `approve()` function is not checked, potentially leading to silent approval failures. This vulnerability is present in the `approveToRouter()` function.
Not all IERC20 implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `approve()` and in this case the the WBGL token is one of those and it is one of the tokens intended to be integrated with the protocol. The current implementation address of the WBGL token on Etherscan is [0xbaa1f3257d808c5078f25e8405da4a703485eb3e](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbaa1f3257d808c5078f25e8405da4a703485eb3e).

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability can be found in the following code snippet:

```solidity
function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
    IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
        address(uniRouter),
        0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
    );
}
```

In this code, the `approveToRouter()` function approves the `_token` address for the Uniswap router, note that this could be the WBGL token. However, it does not check the return value of the `approve()` function to ensure that the approval was successful. This can lead to silent approval failures, where the approval is not properly executed, but the failure is not detected.

Here is the code snippet from the WBGL token contract that defines the `approve()` function:

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
```

The `approve()` function allows the caller to set an allowance for `spender` to spend `amount` tokens from the caller's balance. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the approval operation succeeded.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that if the approval fails silently, it can cause issues in the smooth integration of the protocol with the WBGL token. The failure may result in transactions being blocked or not executed as intended, leading to unexpected behavior.
It is important to ensure the successful execution of the approval to avoid any disruptions in the integration process.

## Code Snippet

Here is the vulnerable code snippet from the USSD contract:
[approveToRouter()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L242-L247)
```solidity
function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
    IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
        address(uniRouter),
        0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
    );
}
```
## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

To mitigate the vulnerability, it is crucial to check the return value of the `approve()` function to ensure that the approval was successful. This can be done by capturing the return value and verifying that it is true. If the return value is false, appropriate actions should be taken to handle the approval failure and notify the user or contract owner.

Here's an example of how to check the return value:

```solidity
function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
    require(
        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
            address(uniRouter),
            0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        ),
        "approval failed"
    );
}
```

By checking the return value and adding appropriate error handling, the USSD contract can ensure that the approval to the Uniswap router is executed successfully, and any approval failures can be properly detected and handled. This will help maintain the smooth integration of the protocol with these type of tokens that don't revert on approval failures like the WBGL token and prevent potential disruptions in functionality.
