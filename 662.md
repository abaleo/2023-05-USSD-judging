# Vulnerability in `getPriceUSD` Function Due to Incorrect Time Period Setting

## Summary
The `getPriceUSD` function fetches the price of DAI against WETH from Uniswap v3 pools for a specified time period. However, setting the time period to 600 seconds (10 minutes) instead of the recommended 1800 seconds (30 minutes) could introduce several issues. These include potential inaccuracies in price estimations due to stale data, increased vulnerability to price manipulation, higher probability of price spikes or outliers

## Vulnerability Detail

By using a shorter time period, the function fetches price data from Uniswap v3 pools within a 10-minute window. This increases the likelihood of retrieving stale or outdated price data, potentially leading to inaccurate price estimations. Additionally, shorter time periods make the price calculation more susceptible to price manipulation attacks and can magnify the impact of price spikes or outliers in the data.

## Impact

The impact of setting the time period to 600 seconds includes:

1): Inaccurate Price Estimations: Using stale or outdated price data due to the shorter time period may not accurately reflect the current market price.

2): Increased Vulnerability to Price Manipulation: Shorter time periods increase the window for price manipulation attacks. Attackers can influence the price of DAI against WETH within a 10-minute window, potentially leading to inaccurate estimations and unfair trading conditions.

```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set the time period to the recommended value of 1800 seconds (30 minutes) or longer. This provides a more reliable and accurate estimation of the price and reduces vulnerability to manipulation attacks.
