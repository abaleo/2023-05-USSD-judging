# The Pool Is Initialized In An Unbalanced State

## Summary

According to the docs "USSD coin is ’initialized’ with one-time minting of 1000 USSD, taking 1000
DAI as collateral. This 1000 USSD would allow to create a pool USSD/DAI to
have initial liquidity. "  , but no DAI is taken as collateral when the pool is initialized with 10_000 USSD (also a small issue , docs says 1000 not 10000).

## Vulnerability Detail

Here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L42  , 10_000
USSD is minted to the deployer , but no collateral is taken i.e. 10_000 DAI. 
Therefore the pool would be in an unbalanced state initially as the pool would not have sufficient liquidity , and USSD logic and peg would fail. 
Eventhough the owner or anyone can send DAI at anytime , In my opinion this qualifies for an eligible unwanted state vuln.

## Impact

The pool would be in an unbalanced state initially as the pool would not have sufficient liquidity , and USSD logic and peg would fail.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

During deployment take 10_000 DAI from the deployer.
