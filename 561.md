# Access control vulnerabilities on USSD.mintRebalancer() and USSD.burnRebalancer()

## Summary
The USSD contract, while featuring various functionalities like token minting and burning, has exposed vulnerabilities related to access control. The `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions lack appropriate access controls, which potentially allows unauthorized minting or burning of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions lack the appropriate access controls. This omission leaves the contract exposed, allowing any address to mint or burn tokens to/from the contract.

## Impact
The lack of access controls on `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` potentially exposes the contract to unauthorized token minting or burning, which could lead to undesired inflation or deflation of `USSD` token supply.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Incorporate appropriate access control modifiers, e.g. `onlyControl` in `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions. This addition will ensure that only authorized addresses have the ability to interact with these functionalities.
