# Unprotected slippage tolerance can lead to user/protocol loss of funds

## Summary

The USSDRebalancer contract executes swaps without slippage protection. This may cause a loss of funds because of sandwich attacks (especially during times of high volatility when large swaps can be executed).

## Vulnerability Detail
Swaps in the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` and `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` functions will be sandwiched causing a loss of funds for users and the protocol.

## Impact

Loss of funds due to sandwich attacks.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Slippage parameters should be passed to the `UniV3SwapInput ` function. You may use an oracle to get an estimate of the price.
