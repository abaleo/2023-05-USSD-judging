# Incorrect decimal of the DAI/ETH price feed

## Summary

The return value of the DAI/ETH price feed has 18 decimals. However, it is treated as 8 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

The price feed of DAI/ETH is obtained from the contract: `0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4`. The decimal of the return value is 18.

        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();

However, when calculating the price in USD of DAI, it was incorrectly scaled up by 1e10 (it incorrectly assumes that the decimal is 8). This leads to a wrong price of DAI.

        ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);

## Impact

The StableOracleDAI returns an inaccurate price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the scale factor:

```diff
-    ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
+    ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price)) / 2);
```
