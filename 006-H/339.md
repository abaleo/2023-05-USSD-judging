# USSD contract lacks a function that allows to redeem USSD for DAI

## Summary

See Vulnerability Detail

## Vulnerability Detail

Whitepaper specifies that USSD should be able to be reedemed and minted for DAI at any given time, but the contract lacks a function for reedeming.

## Impact

Users wont be able to reedem USSD for DAI, which as the whitepaper is important to rebalance the token when needed. This can be read on section 4. Mint and Reedem.

## Code Snippet

When adding collateral there is a parameter to specify if the collateral can be used on redeems.

Add a function to allow users to redeem USSD for DAI when the contract has a surplus of DAI as per the whitepaper mentions
