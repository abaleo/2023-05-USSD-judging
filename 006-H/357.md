# The `USSD` contract doesn't have any mechanism for `Redeeming`.

[Line of code](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L150)
## Summary
The `USSD` Contract doesn't have the `redeem` function, which is responsible for providing a `collateral` for an equal amount of `USSD`.
## Vulnerability Detail
The documentation of `USSD`(White-Paper) it explicity states that.
```docs
If there is positive DAI balance in the collateral, USSD contract can provide DAI for equal amount of USSD in return (that would be burned, contracting supply).
At any given time, USSD can be minted using DAI as collateral at 1-to-1 ratio, expanding total USSD supply.
Ability to mint and redeem USSD for DAI could serve as incentives to re- balance the coin when this is economically viable (covering the gas expenses). 
```
Although this was just a simple mistake that could be made by anyone, an expection of the `redeem` function was made, but the implemention of the `mintForToken` function was made in the `USSD` contract,
```solidity
    function mintForToken(
        address token,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address to
    ) public returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
        require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token");

        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            tokenAmount
        );
        stableCoinAmount = calculateMint(token, tokenAmount);
        _mint(to, stableCoinAmount);

        emit Mint(msg.sender, to, token, tokenAmount, stableCoinAmount);
    }
```
## Impact
The reasons why there should be a `redeem` function, is all stated in the docs, below is a snippet of one.
```docs
These methods also could be used to help USSD recover in negative scenarios: if USSD value falls below 1 DAI and there are less than 1 DAI reserves per USSD to refill the reserves allowing the USSD to recover it's price by reducing supply (at the expense of the agent performing that).
```
The exemption of a `redeem` function has both economical and protocol based logic effects, as stated in the WhitePaper.

## Tool used

Manual Review.

## Recommendation
**The solution to this would be to create a mechanism for redeeming.**
- A function to calculate the amount of ussd to burn for a `collateral`.
- A function to redeem` a token for USSD.
A dummy for how the `redeem function should look like.
```solidity
    function redeemForUSSD(
        uint256 amount,
        address to
    ) public returns (uint256 collateral) {
        require(balance[msg.sender] > amount, "insufficient balance bro");
        collateral = calculateBurn(USSD, amount);
        _burn(address(this), amount);
      USSD.safeTransfer(
            to,
            amount
        );
        emit BURN(msg.sender, to, token, tokenAmount, stableCoinAmount);
    }
```
Remember this is a dummy and the `redeemForUSSd` and other functions it may call should be implemented correctly.
