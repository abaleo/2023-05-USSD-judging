# function calculateMint() in USSD contract doesn't take into account 8 decimals of WBTC

## Summary


## Vulnerability Detail

First of all, we can't be sure how this dAPP gets prices for WBTC from Oracles because the contract StableOracleWBTC that is supposed to get this price has all data to get prices for ETH from Chainlink. For some reason, devs didn't add data for WBTC so we can't test it.

But as we can see from their comments: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L8-L10

They are going to use Chainlink which returns 8 decimals result. Also, let's suppose that they will make the same formula as they use in ETH Oracle adjusting results to 18 decimals : 
    // chainlink price data is 8 decimals
        return uint256(price) * 1e10;

In the minting formula we see the following: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L170-L173

In the case of using the WBTC denominator will be 10**8. So for every amount of WBTC less than 1e-2, we will receive 0 USSD due to rounding in solidity.

For example, if the price of WBTC is 26000 dollars, and we want to deposit WBTC value of 26 dollars we'll receive:

(((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());

(((26000*1e18 * 1e-3) / 1e18) * (10 ** 6)) / (10 ** 8) = 0;

## Impact

Users will receive significantly less or even 0 depositing WBTC.

## Recommendation

As we don't have a code for getting WBTC prices in a codebase it's hard to give exact recommendations. But it's important to take into account tokens that have non-18 decimals and rules of division in solidity.
In this case, you can use decimals from USSD in the denominator, not from the asset.
