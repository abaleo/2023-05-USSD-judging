# Missing `deadline` checks allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed

## Summary
it should provide their users with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as swaps or adding and removing liquidity. The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter

If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades.An even worse way this issue can be maliciously exploited is through MEV.


## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
contracts/USSD.sol:
  226  
  227:     function UniV3SwapInput(
  228:         bytes memory _path,
  229:         uint256 _sellAmount
  230:     ) public override onlyBalancer {
  231:         IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
  232:             .ExactInputParams({
  233:                 path: _path,
  234:                 recipient: address(this),
  235:                 //deadline: block.timestamp, // @audit
  236:                 amountIn: _sellAmount,
  237:                 amountOutMinimum: 0
  238:             });
  239:         uniRouter.exactInput(params);
  240:     }
  241: 
  242:     function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
  243:         IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
  244:             address(uniRouter),
  245:             0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
  246:         );
  247:     }
  248  }

## Recommendation
Introduce a deadline parameter to all functions which potentially perform a swap on the user's behalf.
