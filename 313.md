# Reverting on interaction with Chainlink price feeds and and Uniswap V3 pools is not handled and can lead to Denial of Service

## Summary

The USSD project relies heavily on Chainlink price feeds and Uniswap V3 Pools.

It states in its whitepaper that it "would be kept upgradeable (for a limited time, and then locked afterwards)".  Once the project is locked price feeds and pools are no more upgradeable.

If any of the price feeds or pools reverts this leads to a state of DOS for the project.

## Vulnerability Detail

### For Chainlink price feeds the `latestRoundData` function is called which may revert:
https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L48
https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol#L23
https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L23

Chainlink's multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at any time. The result is a denial of service.

### For Uniswap V3 pools the `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` function is called which may revert:
https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBGL.sol#L28

## Impact

The project is put into a state of DOS it cannot recover from.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to employ a defensive approach when querying Chainlink price feeds and Uniswap V3 oracles.

Those calls should be surrounded with try/catch. This way, if the call fails, the calling contract retains control and can handle any errors safely and explicitly.

It is advisable to implement a backup solution for each price feed and pool using an alternative provider.
