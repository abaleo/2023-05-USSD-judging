# Unchecked Token Address in getCollateralIndex() Function Leads to Incorrect Index Return

## Summary

The getCollateralIndex() function in the provided USSD smart contract contains a vulnerability that can lead to the return of an incorrect collateral index. This function is expected to return the index of a specific token address in the collateral[] array. However, if the token address does not exist in the array, it will return the last index of the array. This behavior could lead to improper protocol operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

The getCollateralIndex() function is designed to loop through the collateral[] array to find a match for a provided token address. Once found, it returns the index at which the token exists in the array. If the token address does not exist in the array, the function should ideally revert or return an error even if for now, this function is used only after some checks that the token address in the collateral array, in the future if there are modifications it is better to re-write a safe function, which is not the case here.

In its current state, the function simply exits and returns the last index that the loop iterated over (which is the last index of the collateral[] array). This behavior could lead to a situation where the function returns an index that is not associated with the requested token address, which might lead to undesirable effects in other parts of the smart contract that rely on the getCollateralIndex() function for proper execution.

## Impact

The vulnerability could lead to incorrect execution of operations in other parts of the contract that rely on the getCollateralIndex() function. If the index returned by getCollateralIndex() is used to perform operations on the collateral[] array, such as retrieving or updating a collateral token's information, these operations could end up being executed on the wrong collateral token. This could potentially lead to loss of funds, incorrect calculations, or other unintended outcomes.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L125-L133
```solidity
    function getCollateralIndex(
        address _token
    ) public view returns (uint256 index) {
        for (index = 0; index < collateral.length; index++) {
            if (collateral[index].token == _token) {
                return index;
            }
        }
        //E @audit-issue will return last index
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, the function should be updated to throw an error or revert when the requested token address is not found in the collateral[] array. 
```solidity
function getCollateralIndex(address _token) public view returns (uint256 index) {
    for (index = 0; index < collateral.length; index++) {
        if (collateral[index].token == _token) {
            return index;
        }
    }
    revert("Token address not found in collateral array");
}
```
By implementing this change, you can ensure that the getCollateralIndex() function does not return an incorrect index when the token address does not exist in the collateral[] array. This will prevent the function from potentially causing incorrect operations in other parts of the contract.
