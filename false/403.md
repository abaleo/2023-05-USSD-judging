# Uniswap V3 fee is hardcoded in the path which could be problematic if the Uniswap V3 pool is changed

## Summary
In `USSDRebalancer` contract `USSD.UniV3SwapInput` function is called multiple times in multiple instances. One of the parameters for that function is `_path`, which is created via `bytes.concat`.

The issue is that in multiple instances where `UniV3SwapInput` is called, a hardcoded fee is used (`hex"0001f4"`). This can cause an issue if the pool with fee 0.05% doesn't have enough liquidity.

## Vulnerability Detail
Example from `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function:
```solidity
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token1(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token0())), amount);
```
`hex"0001f4"` value is the fee of the pool, which is hardcoded.

This means that if the `uniPool` address is changed for a pool, that has a different fee (0.01%, 0.30% or 1%), the swap will not be called through that pool.

## Impact
If the pool with 0.05% fee does not have enough liquidity, multiple actions in `USSDRebalancer` will be DoS because the fee in path is hardcoded.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the part where the path is built according to Uniswap's example https://uniswapv3book.com/docs/milestone_4/path/#path-library

```solidity
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(
            bytes20(uniPool.token1()),
            bytes3(uniPool.fee()),
            bytes20(uniPool.token0())
        ), amount); 
```
