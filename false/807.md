# initialize() functions can be frontrun

## Summary
Both `USSD.initialize()` and `USSDRebalancer.initialize()` can be front runned.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `initialize()` functions can be called by anyone.

## Impact
An attacker can initialize the contracts before deployer, hoping that the victim continues to use same contract. In best case deployer notice it and have to redeploy the contracts costing gas.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider restricting the initialize functions to the original deployer of the contract.
