# Price Manipulation via Low TWAP Period


## Summary

The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate prices by exploiting the low TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) period set in the `IStaticOracle` contract. If an extremely low TWAP period is specified, the attacker can distort price calculations within the protocol, potentially leading to incorrect price quotes and financial losses.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `IStaticOracle` contract serves as an oracle for calculating price quotes based on Uniswap V3 pools. However, there is a vulnerability related to the `period` parameter used in various functions throughout the contract.

```solidity
// @audit below `period` is used, but this could be any value even as low as 10 seconds (if not even lower), essentially meaning that it could easily be influenced by an attacker?
function quoteAllAvailablePoolsWithTimePeriod(
  uint128 baseAmount,
  address baseToken,
  address quoteToken,
  uint32 period
) external view returns (uint256 quoteAmount, address[] memory queriedPools);

function quoteSpecificFeeTiersWithTimePeriod(
  uint128 baseAmount,
  address baseToken,
  address quoteToken,
  uint24[] calldata feeTiers,
  uint32 period
) external view returns (uint256 quoteAmount, address[] memory queriedPools);

function quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
  uint128 baseAmount,
  address baseToken,
  address quoteToken,
  address[] calldata pools,
  uint32 period
) external view returns (uint256 quoteAmount);
```

The `period` parameter determines the duration for which the TWAP should be calculated. However, there are no checks or restrictions on the value of `period`, allowing it to be set as low as 10 seconds (if not even lower). This means that an attacker can influence this price and also if TWAP is specified as a very low number it doesn't really make sense since the ideology of TWAP would be broken

## Impact

By allowing the `period` parameter to be set to an extremely low value, the correct implementation of TWAP is compromised. This manipulation enables the attacker to influence the price quotes obtained from the oracle. Subsequently, these manipulated prices can propagate throughout the system, potentially causing financial losses, inaccurate trading decisions, and other security issues.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendations

To address this vulnerability, the following recommendations are provided:

1. Implement a minimum duration for the `period` parameter in the functions that utilize it. The minimum duration should be set to a reasonable value to ensure accurate TWAP calculations.

2. Perform input validation to ensure that the `period` parameter meets the minimum duration requirement. If the provided `period` value is below the minimum duration, the function should revert with an appropriate error message.

3. Consider implementing additional checks to validate the `period` value and prevent manipulation by potential attackers. This can include enforcing a maximum duration for the `period` or implementing other safeguards to ensure the integrity of TWAP calculations.
