# There is no input validation for `setPoolAddress`

## Summary

Function `setPoolAddress` has no validation, so it can be set as any pool address. This can cause unexpected behaviors in the protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `setPoolAddress` has no validation, so the pool address can be set as an arbitrary address when human error occurs. Although if the admin takes care of it with carefulness this can be avoid. It should be stopped on the code base level. 

## Impact

The pool is set as a wrong address. 
Function `getOwnValuation` will stop working properly or get wrong price in the first place. 
Then it can cause the function `rebalance` to stop working. That is because function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` and `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` stopped working. As a result, USSD can de-peg from the expected level and lose the trust from the users and the market. 

In the worst case scenario, if the admin changed the pool address and renounce the ownership the contract is locked down and nothing can be changed. USSD will be de-pegged forever. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: USSDRebalancer.sol
51:       // @audit should validate the pool address is a uniswap v3 pool with USSD token. any other pool set will make the system unable to work. e.g. the getOwnValuation will get totally wrong value to the protocol.
52:       uniPool = IUniswapV3Pool(_pool); // @audit-info uniswap v3 pool 
53:     }
```

```solidity
File: USSDRebalancer.sol
71:     /// @dev get price estimation to DAI using pool address and uniswap price
72:     function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
73:       (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
74:       if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) { // @audit-info should be token0 or tokne1 is USSD so the first case is if, the second case is else
75:         price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2); // @audit Because the unipool can be set as arbitrary, what if neither token0 nor token1 is USSD? This should be a case to be considered
76:       } else 
77:         price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
78:         // flip the fraction
79:         price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
80:       }
81:     }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add this validation into the function to avoid any kind of human error which can cause the autonomous stable coin to get paralyzed. 

```diff
function setPoolAddress(address _pool) public onlyControl {
+    require(IUniswapV3Pool(_pool).token0 == USSD || IUniswapV3Pool(_pool).token1 == USSD, "invalid pool");
     uniPool = IUniswapV3Pool(_pool); 
    }
```
