# Lack of Whitelists to Ensure Integration of Tokens in Protocol are Done Correctly

## Summary

The contracts in scope, take the USSD contract for an example lacks a whitelist mechanism to restrict token integration. This vulnerability allows for the potential integration of tokens with different security considerations or incompatible functionalities, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The USSD contract does not implement a whitelist for supported tokens, contrary to the specifications outlined in the protocol's whitepaper. According to the whitepaper, only four tokens should be integrated with the protocol: DAI, ETH, BTC, and WBGL. However, the contract does not enforce this restriction, enabling the integration of any token.

## Impact

The absence of whitelists in the USSD contract exposes the protocol to the integration of unauthorized tokens. This can lead to unforeseen security risks, compatibility issues, or the exploitation of vulnerabilities in unsupported tokens. Without proper validation, the integration of additional tokens may compromise the stability and security of the USSD protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability and align with the protocol's whitepaper, it is recommended to implement a whitelist mechanism to restrict token integration. The following steps are suggested:

1. Create a whitelist array that includes the addresses of the approved tokens: DAI, ETH, BTC, and WBGL.
2. Restrict token integration to only the tokens listed in the whitelist array.
3. Document the approved token addresses and their functionalities in the protocol's documentation to ensure consistency and clarity.

By implementing these measures, the USSD protocol can enforce token compatibility, maintain security standards, and mitigate the risks associated with the integration of unauthorized tokens.
