# A malicious user can exploit `approveToRouter`

## Summary
In `USSD.sol` we have `approveToRouter()` function:
```solidity
function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
            address(uniRouter),          
            0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        );
    }
```

This function is to grant the Uniswap V3 router contract permission to transfer tokens from the contract that executes this function. 
`0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` is mean unlimited approval.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem here is that `approveToRouter()` is public and there is no access control. 
This could potentially expose the contract to security risks if called by a malicious user.

If a malicious user were to call this function on behalf of the contract owner or another address with significant token holdings, it would grant the Uniswap V3 router contract unlimited access to transfer tokens from that address. 

## Impact

This could potentially lead to unauthorized transfers or token theft.

## Recommendation

Add access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the `approveToRouter` function, to ensure that only trusted and authorized entities can execute this function.
