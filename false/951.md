# WEIRD edge case by same dai and USSD amount

## Summary
if the price is bad enough and ussd is undervalued by alot and someone sends 1 wei of dai to the pool contract they will cause this function to revert and cause more loss ex:1e18 and 1e18 in the pool itself which is a crazy number of ussd tokens
More this  is an edge case here that if both amounts are 1e18 which is possible or if they are the same value because of over value of certain conditions then USSD won't be able to be rebalanced in the contract
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Rebalance wont be able to happen /undeisred state 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
```
## Tool used

## Recommendation
change it to revert on 0
