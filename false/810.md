# Attacker Can Make The Rebalance Revert Everytime

## Summary

Rebalance is the core logic of the protocol to maintain the peg. The attacker can manipulate the tx and make the 
rebalance function revert everytime , thus hindering with the recovery of the peg.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the rebalance function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L92
During a peg-down recovery it calls BuyUSSDCollateral here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L97
The logic reaches L123(both if conditions pass , there is a path to sell and collateralval > amountToBuyLeftUSD) where `amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore)`
Now assume

1. ) Attacker watches the mempool and sees the rebalance call (peg-down recovery)
2. ) Sends baseAsset to the USSD contract such that `amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore)` would revert (makes the (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) big) .
3. ) In this situation there can't be a recovery as the call would revert due to overflow.

Attacker can keep doing this and make the contract freeze i.e. no rebalance would be done and USSD would eventually loose it's peg

## Impact

Attacker can keep fromtrunning and make the contract freeze i.e. no rebalance would be done and USSD would eventually loose it's peg

## Recommendation

Make sure attacker can't make the tx revert.
