# Users can abuse difference between oracle price and actual price.

## Summary
Chain link oracles have a heartbeat and a price deviation threshold. And only when one of those conditions are met does the price of the oracle actually update. For Dai/Eth the  deviation is 1% and the threshold is 86400 seconds. This means that if the price stays within 1% of the actual price for 86399 seconds the price wont actually change. for example if Dai is at 1.00 when an update happens it can decrease down to .991 with out the price updating.  If a user knew about this can take advantage and mint a bunch of USSD with the oracle showing a price of 1.00 even though it is less than this. The user can then swap the USSD back to dai a second later for a guaranteed profit. The 1% may not seem big but with a large enough sum a user could get away with minting at a discount risk free at the expense of the protocol. This would be relatively easy to do and could be done over and over with no risk.

## Recommendation
The minting functionality needs to have a fee that wold make this attack unprofitable.
