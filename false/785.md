# `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` reverts when there's not enough DAI to fully recover the peg (but enough of other collateral)

## Summary

`BuyUSSDSellCollateral` reverts when there's not enough DAI to fully recover the peg but enough to recover some of it. This happens because of passing empty `path` to `UniswapV3Router.exactInput`.

## Vulnerability Detail

First, let's notice that if `path` argument passed to `UniswapV3Router.exactInput` is an empty array, then call reverts with `slice_outOfBounds`. I tested this in foundry, and these lines of code in Uniswap are relevant: [1](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/SwapRouter.sol#L30), [2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/SwapRouter.sol#L150), [3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/libraries/Path.sol#L60), [4](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/libraries/Path.sol#L8), [5](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/libraries/BytesLib.sol#L19).

Now, let's examine these lines of code: [1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L119), [2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L125-L126). As we can see, `collateral[i].pathsell.length` is `0` for DAI collateral and this zero value is used in `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` to treat DAI differently from other collateral tokens.

Namely, it's used to avoid calling `IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, amountToSellUnits);` for DAI, because it'd end up in revert casued by passing empty `collateral[i].pathsell` to `UniswapRouter.exactInput`.

However, this "edge case" of DAI collateral is handled properly only if there's enough DAI collateral to do full repeg (i.e. if [this if condition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L117) is true).

In case, when there's not enough DAI in `USSD` contract to do full repeg but enough to buy 5% of amount of USSD needed for repeg, [these lines of code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L130-L137) are reached with `collateral[i].token == DAI` and (what follows) `collateral[i].pathsell.length == 0`.

Then `IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD));` is called with `collateral[i].pathsell.length == 0` so it reverts. 

## Impact

In case, when there's not enough DAI to recover peg in the USSD/DAI Uniswap pool but enough to buy 5% of USSD needed to recover the peg, `USSDRebalancer.rebalance()` will revert.

It can happen, e.g. if there was a huge trade executed on the USSD/DAI `uniPool` or `USSD` contract happens to run low on DAI.

What happens next, is probably many people selling their USSD because not many people feel comfortable holding depegged stablecoins. So USSD will lose it's value and depeg further (until DAI collateral is no longer enough to buy 5% USSD needed for the full repeg and next collateral (WETH) is used).

So net effect will be way too much collateral used up to recover the peg and loss of trust in USSD because of evidence that it can depeg.
