# Underflow when there is more dai than ussd

## Summary
`rebalance()` will revert if `ownValue` is below threshold and DAI amount is greater than USSD.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `rebalance()` there is a if `ownVal` is below the threshhold then it will enter the if block. In here `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` is called and `USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2` is passed in as a parameter. The problem here is that if DAIamount is greater than USSDamount then a underflow will occur and the transaction will revert.  DAI amount can become greater than ussd through the natural progression of the protocol. Or becasue it is a erc20 token and DAIamount is retrieved by getting the direct balance of DAI a user can just send DAI to the contract and force it to revert for all other users. 

`      uint256 vol2 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token1()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));`

Here is the math to support the function reverting. 

`(USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2`
`(1e6 - 2e18 / 1e12) / 2`
`(1e6 - 2e6) / 2`
`(-1e6) / 2   <----- underflow, transaction will revert.`

The same can be said for when USSD is greater than DAI and `rebalance()` enters the else block. 
## Impact
`rebalance()` will revert and prevent the protocol from working.

## Recommendation
Have a check in place to checks if DAI is greater and if it is use a work around to prevent the functionality from breaking.
