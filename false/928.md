# If the first rebalance dosnt have collateral for each token it will revert

## Summary
The protocol should work with 3 tokens backing up the protocol and then on the rebalance it will smooth out the collateral amounts. But since the 4 token has 0 collateral the uniswap function will revert, causing rebalance to fall and keeping USSS depeged
## Vulnerability Detail
Since the uni swap routerV3 cant handle 0 amounts

Here is the polygon pool it's the same thing I just Used this one for reference
```solidity
->exactInput->exactInputInternal->swap require(amountSpecified != 0, 'AS');
```

## Impact
rebalance will revert causing gas issues and it keeps USSD depegged for longer causing a lot of harm to the protocol
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a check if 0 amount skip the swapping and move on to the next token since it works fine with collateralFactor function if 1 collateral is not used.
Since the flutter rates are not synced until after this is a risk that the admin will have to control it, but there is no reason to with this check.
