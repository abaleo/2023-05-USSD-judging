# In SellUSSDBuyCollateral, the decimal is not taken into account in the swap calculation, so unscheduled quantities are swapped.

## Summary
Among the assumed collateral, the decimal for WBTC is 8, and the others are 18.
This does not appear to have been taken into account in the swap calculation.
## Vulnerability Detail
At the end of the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` process, there is a process `IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought / portions)`.
Here, `daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought`, calculated in DAI decimal.
Since `portions` also have no role in adjusting decimal, if the collateral was WBTC, a large calculation error would occur.
## Impact
Significant token calculation errors could occur and an unscheduled amount could be swapped.
