# Infinite approvals

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Infinite approvals are granted to the uniswap router. Incase of malfunction/compromise, all the funds can be drained. This goes for all the tokens owned by USSD contract as the approval function is callable by anyone to pass in a token.

```solidity
   function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
            address(uniRouter),
            0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        );
    }
``` 
## Impact
Incase of uniswap router malfunction/compromise, all the funds can be drained.
