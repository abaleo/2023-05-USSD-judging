# Decimal scaling is not appropriate in DAItosell calculations

## Summary
Within `BuyUSSDSellCollateral`, there is a process to convert DAI to USSD.
In this case, collateral with different decimal will cause inconvenience in the calculation.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral`function, the following formula is used.

`DAItosell = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * amountToBuyLeftUSD / collateralval;`

This is then the quantity of the Uniswap input as it is.
In the collateral, WBTC has a decimal of 8 and DAI of 18. Therefore, 1e10 different values would be calculated and swapped.
## Impact
Significant discrepancy in the quantity of tokens during token swap
