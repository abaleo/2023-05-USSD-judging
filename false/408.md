# Division by zero error

## Summary
There is a possibility of encountering a division by zero error if _sqrtPriceX96_ value is a zero in the function get Own Valuation.
## Vulnerability Detail

The function get own valuation first checks if the base token is ussd . if it is goes own to get the 'price' by multiplying _sqrtPriceX96_ with itself and then dividing by 1e6. The result is then right-shifted with (96*2) which converts it to an integer. In the case that the base token is DAI , the 'price' is calculated in in a similar manner but with an additional step to flip the fraction. Therefore if the value _sqrtPriceX96_ is a zero or is rounded down to zero it will to a division by zero error.

## Impact

The worst case scenario is that the normal flow of execution of the contract is disrupted.
