# Better not to fix swap path

## Summary

When `rebalance()`, the `pathbuy/pathsell` is read from the collateral strut stored. However, as uniswap pools are dynamically updating, the stored path might not be optimal. The contract could lose some fund during every swap.

## Vulnerability Detail

The path stored in the collateral strut coudl be WETH_USDC_DAI, however, as the pool actively updating, when `rebalance()` is called, the best path could change to WETH_USDT_USDC_DAI. Stick to one path could not be optimal, and the effective swap price could be higher. 

## Impact

When `rebalance()`, the contract could lose some fund due to non optimal swap path.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Dynamically provide the swap path, maybe pre calculate in the frontend. Like Uniswap, or use just use Uniswap frontend for the best path.
