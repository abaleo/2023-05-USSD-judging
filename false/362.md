# Contract gives max approvals to router and there is no way to remove them

## Summary
Contract gives max approvals to router and there is no way to remove them, could lead to loss of funds in the future.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here the function [`approveToRouter()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L242-L247) is implemented, giving **type(uint256).max** approval to the chosen router. This is not a good decision, because there is no way for these approvals to be removed or set to 0. Recently there was an [attack](https://cryptoslate.com/sushiswap-token-allocation-exploit-drains-3-3m-as-users-urged-to-revoke-token-allowances-immediately/) to SUSHI swap, that exploited the approvals. For people to keep their funds safe they needed to remove the approval ( **approve(0)** )  for the SUSHI router. This happened to one of the biggest exchanges and could happen to UNI too. My suggestion is to make the approvals on the trade, this means to approve only the desired amount and nothing more. 
## Impact
Could lead to loss of funds in the future.
## Code Snippet
```jsx
   function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
       IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
           address(uniRouter),
           0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        );
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Approve only what is needed to do the trade.
```jsx
    function UniV3SwapInput(bytes memory _path, uint256 _sellAmount) public override onlyBalancer {
+      token.approve(address(IV3SwapRouter),_sellAmount);
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
            path: _path,
            recipient: address(this),
            //deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: _sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: 0
        });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
