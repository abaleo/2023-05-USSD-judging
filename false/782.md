# DAI depeg price could lead to USSD hyperinflation

## Summary

DAI depeg price would lead to USSD hyperinflation.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol whitepaper mentions a number of disadvantages of existing stablecoins, compare to which USSD should be a more reliable token. One such disadvantage for DAI tokens is the high dependence on USDC price, which could lead to DAI depeg in the case of USDC depeg. USSD itself relies on a few different collaterals with a much higher collateralization ratio (500% vs 147%) that should guarantee more stability of its price according to the whitepaper.
However since rebalancing flow fully depends on the current USSD/DAI price, the DAI depeg (initialized by the USDC depeg for example) could result in high inflation of USSD tokens. 

## Impact

USSD could use in value through rebalancing in case of a DAI depeg incident, while the whitepaper declares USSD as a more reliable stablecoin than existing ones. This could highly mislead protocol users.
