# Potential Revert Due to Underflow in USSD.sol during Collateral Selling

## Summary
`USSD.sol` contains a vulnerability where an underflow can occur during collateral selling when using the exactInput method. This vulnerability arises when the amount of collateral sold exceeds the `amountToBuyLeftUSD`, leading to an underflow during the calculation `amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore)`. As a result, the rebalancing process fails, hindering the desired outcome.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the use of the exactInput method during collateral selling in `USSD.sol`. The `exactInput` method aims to sell a specific quantity of collateral while maximizing the output received. However, in the given contract, using `exactInput` can lead to a situation where more output is received than the desired `amountToBuyLeftUSD`. This causes the calculation `amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore)` to result in an underflow, triggering a revert. Consequently, the rebalancing process fails, preventing the intended outcome from being achieved.


## Impact
The vulnerability in `USSD.sol` can result in a failed rebalancing process during collateral selling. If the amount of collateral sold exceeds the `amountToBuyLeftUSD`, an underflow occurs, leading to a revert. This failure prevents the rebalancing mechanism from achieving the desired outcome, potentially leaving the USSD price vulnerable during a depegged state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the `exactOutput` method instead of `exactInput` when selling collateral in `USSD.sol`. The `exactOutput` method allows for specifying the desired output quantity. This approach ensures that the desired amount of output is received without encountering underflows that reverting transactions.

Alternatively, you can delete the syntax `amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore)` since amountToBuyLeftUSD is not used in the logic.
