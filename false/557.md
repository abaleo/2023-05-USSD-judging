# Possibility of getting impacted by the counter party risk(centralization risk) cannot be ignored by design

## Summary

There are several counter party risks(centralization risks) in terms of the selection of the collateral tokens except wETH. 

## Vulnerability Details

In the [white paper](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-whitepaper/blob/main/whitepaper.pdf), it mentioned the things below. I will list them up: 

> 1 DAI as a stable coin has its downside of centralization risks. The team can freeze tokens.
> 2 USSD operates independently of any business model. USSD’s operation would not be dependent on any person in the long term.
>  3 DAI, wETH, wBTC and wBGL are the selected collaterals for the protocol at the moment. 

As far as what I have researched, although DAI has no functionality of freezing or blacklisting tokens, it can still [have some centralization risk](https://thedefiant.io/tornado-impact-makerdao-dai). And it is backed by USDC which is a Fiat-backed totally centralized stable coin. 

And wBTC or wBGL is a wrapped token derived from the token on the original networks. Because they need to get wrapped to live on Ethereum, they are also centralized and hence have certain level of centralization risks. 

wBGL is a fork of Bitcoin and in the white paper the author mentioned it is a radical element in the collateral structure. Because it is a fork of BTC, it is supposed to be less decentralized when comparing with ETH or BTC. And it is also a wrapped coin on Ethereum. As a result, it also has a big potential counter party risk. 

This is not fulfilling the goal the protocol wants to achieve based on the information from the white paper and readme file information. 

## Impact

If any of the centralized party(DAI, wBGL, wBTC) who are in control of the token will end their business or has any trouble in maintaining the value of the token in the future, USSD protocol will get damaged ,or in the worst case scenario, USSD protocol will collapse. And hopefully nothing we can do against it because there is no `admin` role at that time(sponsor mentioned they are going to renounce the ownership to make protocol autonomous). 



## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: USSD.sol
084:     function addCollateral(
085:         address _address,
086:         address _oracle,
087:         bool _mint,
088:         bool _redeem,
089:         uint256[] calldata _ratios, 
090:         bytes memory _pathbuy, 
091:         bytes memory _pathsell,
092:         uint256 index // 
093:     ) public onlyControl { 
094:         CollateralInfo memory newCollateral = CollateralInfo({
095:             token: _address,
096:             mint: _mint,
097:             redeem: _redeem,

100:             pathsell: _pathsell,
101:             ratios: _ratios
102:         });
103:         if (index < collateral.length) {
104:             collateral[index] = newCollateral; // for editing
105:         } else {
106:             collateral.push(newCollateral); // for adding new collateral
107:         } 
108:     }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reconsider what token should be added as collateral token. For example, because USSD wants to focus on being fully trustless and decentralized to exist in the long term, choosing only wETH can be a good way to avoid the centralization risk I have mentioned above. [The Liquity protocol](https://www.liquity.org/) has a similar approach by choosing only ETH as their LUSD token’s collateral.
