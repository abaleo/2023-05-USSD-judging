# Medium Vuln

## Summary
1. Tokens with more than 18 decimal points will cause issues

## Vulnerability Detail
* Tokens with more than 18 decimal points will cause issues

## Impact
* Precision loss
* Inconsistent representation
* Compatibility issues
* Difficulty in debugging

## Code Snippet
Found in line 76 at USSDRebalancer.sol;
```solidity
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is generally recommended to ensure that your calculations and data handling adhere to the 18-decimal-place limit of Solidity's fixed-point arithmetic. If you need to work with values that have more precision, you may consider using external libraries or implementing custom logic to handle higher precision calculations.
