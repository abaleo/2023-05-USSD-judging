# Manipulation of Valuation through Flash Loans in USSDRebalancer.sol

## Summary
`USSDRebalancer.sol` contains a vulnerability in the `getOwnValuation` function, which can be manipulated through flash loans. This vulnerability allows malicious users to manipulate the USSD/DAI price obtained from the Uniswap pool, potentially leading to profitable exploits by taking advantage of rebalancing trades based on the manipulated valuation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getOwnValuation` function in `USSDRebalancer.sol` retrieves the price of the USSD/DAI pair from the Uniswap pool to determine whether the USSD token is depegged. Based on this valuation, the rebalancer decides whether to purchase USSD tokens as collateral if the price is below the peg or purchase collateral with USSD tokens if the price is high.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `getOwnValuation` function relies solely on the Uniswap pool price, which can be manipulated by an attacker using flash loans. By exploiting flash loans, an attacker can temporarily manipulate the USSD/DAI price in the Uniswap pool, influencing the rebalancer's decisions and potentially profiting from the subsequent rebalancing trades.

## Impact
The vulnerability in `USSDRebalancer.sol` allows an attacker to manipulate the valuation obtained from the Uniswap pool through flash loans. This manipulation can lead to deceptive indications of whether the USSD token is depegged or not. By strategically manipulating the valuation, an attacker can exploit the rebalancing mechanism to their advantage, potentially resulting in financial gain at the expense of other participants.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use multiple price oracles relying on a single price source can be risky. Consider incorporating multiple price oracles or data providers to obtain a more reliable valuation of the USSD token.
