# Approval to Max in USSD Contract

## Summary

The USSD contract sets the approval amount to the maximum value (`0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`) when approving tokens for the router. This practice poses unnecessary vulnerability risks if the approved address ever gets hacked or compromised.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the USSD contract, the `approveToRouter()` function sets the approval amount for a given token to the maximum value. This approach grants the approved address unrestricted access to transfer an unlimited amount of tokens on behalf of the user. While this may be suitable for certain scenarios, it also opens users and protocols to unnecessary risks if the approved address ever gets compromised.
The code snippet below illustrates the vulnerable `approveToRouter()` function, which approves the maximum token amount (`0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`) to the router address:

```solidity
function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
    IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
        address(uniRouter),
        0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
    );
}
```

## Impact

By approving the maximum token amount to a specific address, users and protocols expose themselves to potential losses if the approved address is hacked. If an attacker gains control over the approved address, they can transfer the maximum amount of tokens from the user's account without any additional authorization. This can lead to significant financial losses and disrupt the intended functionality of the USSD protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate the vulnerability and enhance the security of the USSD protocol, the following recommendations are provided:

1. Avoid approving the maximum token amount.
2. Implement granular approval mechanisms that allow users to approve only the necessary amount of tokens required for a specific transaction or interaction with the router.
3. If max approval is needed then provide clear information to users regarding the associated risks.
