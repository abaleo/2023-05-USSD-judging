# Accept Zero Address for `mintForToken()`

## Summary
This lack of input validation allows users to unintentionally send their minted tokens to the Ethereum zero address (0x0), effectively burning these tokens and rendering them irretrievable.

## Vulnerability Detail
The mintForToken function is designed to transfer a specified amount of tokens from a user's account to the smart contract, mint an equivalent amount of stablecoins, and send these stablecoins to a specified address (to). However, there is no validation check to ensure that to is a non-zero address.

## Impact
When tokens are transferred to zero address, the function could end up burning tokens by sending them to an address from which they cannot be retrieved.

## Recommendation
adding `require(to != address(0), "Cannot mint to zero address");`
