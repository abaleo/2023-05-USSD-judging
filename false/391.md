# `USSDRebalancer.rebalance` function can be DoS because of the supply proportion's logic

## Summary
`USSDRebalancer.rebalance` can be DoS, because the function `getSupplyProportion` uses balances from Uniswap V3 pool, where token0 and token1 are not proportional to each other. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`USSDRebalancer.getSupplyPropoprtion` function returns `vol1` and `vol2` values that are `uniPool.token0()` and `uniPool.token1()` balances from Uniswap V3 pool.
```solidity
    function getSupplyProportion() public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
      uint256 vol1 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token0()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));
      uint256 vol2 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token1()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));
      if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        return (vol1, vol2);
      }
      return (vol2, vol1);
    }
```
This is an issue because token0 and token1 in Uniswap V3 are not proportional to each other.

### Example
The difference between Uniswap V2 and V3 is that on V3 liquidity providers can choose the price region where they want to provide the liquidity.

Liquidity provider can choose a region where he needs to provide only 1 asset. Example of DAI/USDC pool

This means that the Uniswap V3 balances can be easily manipulated without changing the price.

And this creates an issue in `rebalance` function, where `getSupplyProportion` values are used, which means that:

1. if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold): 
DAIAmount can be higher than USSDAmount which would make the function fail because of underflow
```solidity
        BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2); 
```

2. else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold)
USSDAmount can be higher than DAIAmount - this can cause underflow
```solidity
        IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100);
```

## Impact
`USSDRebalancer.rebalance` function may be DoS because the `getSupplyProportion` takes balances of token0 and token1 in the Uniswap V3 pool as supply proportion.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't use token0 and token1 balances of Uniswap V3 pool as supply proportions, because those values are not proportional to each other.
