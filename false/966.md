# `USSDRebalancer.getOwnValuation()` is vulnerable to flashswap attack.

## Summary
`USSDRebalancer.getOwnValuation()` depends on the current price. The current price can be manipulated by flashswap attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
In uniswap, the pool first gives the token and takes the other token in `uniswapV3SwapCallback`, so an attacker can manipulate the price of USSD.

0. 10000 DAI - 10000 USSD uniswap v3 pool
1. Swap 1000 USSD to 1000 DAI from the pool and call `USSDRebalancer.rebalance()` in `uniswapV3SwapCallback`. I still have to pay 1000 USSD.
2. The price of DAI increased to $1.1, so `rebalance` function will buy DAI and sell USSD. 
3. Now the price of DAI increases further to $1.2. 
4. I sell the necessary amount of DAI to buy 1000 USSD. The avg price of DAI may be lower than $1.2, but higher than $1.1. I pay at most 1000/1.1 DAI, so I can get at least 90.9 DAI.


## Impact
It is vulnerable to the attack mentioned above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Chainlink or TWAP oracle for price calculation as in [StableOracleDAI](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol).
