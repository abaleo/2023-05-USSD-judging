# The `USSD` has no way to revoke token approvals or set specific values due to `approveToRouter()` implementation

## Summary

`USSD::approveToRouter()` hardcodes an approval of the max uint256 value for the approval amount. 

There is no way to revoke it if the approved address is compromised, and it prevents supporting tokens that do not work with the max value as its amount. On top of that, the access control permission is open, for anyone to approve any tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

`USSD::approveToRouter()` lets any user approve any token, but the contract does not have any way to revoke it or modify the limit, as the amount can't be passed as an argument:

```solidity
    function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
            address(uniRouter),
            0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        );
    }
```

On top of that, it also prevents adding as collateral some popular tokens like `UNI` or `COMP`, as thet revert if the value passed to `approve` than uint96.

## Impact

Inability to revoke approval if `uniRouter` is compromised.

Inability to add tokens that do not support the max uint256 value as its approval amount.

Allows anyone to approve the use of any tokens on this contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow an `amount` value to be passed, and limit the access control with the `onlyControl` modifier.

```diff
-    function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
+    function approveToRouter(address _token, uint256 _amount) public onlyControl {
        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
            address(uniRouter),
-           0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
+           _amount
        );
    }
```
