# Vulnerability in USSDRebalancer's rebalance() Function Leading to Potential Pool Distortion

## Summary

The USSDRebalancer contract suffers from a vulnerability in the rebalance() function where the sale of minted USSD tokens may lead to significant price slippage, impacting the stability of the USSD/DAI pool balance. This, along with transaction fees, may inadvertently create a net loss instead of maintaining a balanced pool.

The rebalance() function is meant to maintain a 1:1 balance in the USSD/DAI pool. However, when the USSD value is greater than the DAI (e.g., 1e6 + 2e4), the function mints and sells USSD tokens to buy back DAI tokens. This sale may lead to a significant price slippage due to the pool's size, especially when a small number of tokens have a substantial impact on the price. Additionally, transaction fees further compound this effect.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's say the pool has 1,000,000 USSD tokens and 2,000,000 DAI tokens, which makes the current price of USSD 2 DAI (due to the 1:2 ratio in the pool). The rebalance function checks the price and identifies that it needs to rebalance.

In the rebalance function: It calculates that it should mint and sell ((2,000,000 / 1e12) - 1,000,000) / 2 * 99 / 100 = 0.0099 USSD tokens.

The function then attempts to execute this operation. However, the pool size is not large enough to absorb this sale without a significant impact on the price, causing high slippage.

This slippage, along with transaction fees, results in an inefficient operation that rather than re-balancing the pool, distorts it even further. The cost of the new USSD tokens is higher than the DAI received in return.

Therefore, this function can potentially lead to significant losses due to high slippage and transaction fees, and even distort the balance of the pool further.

To illustrate, if the slippage is 1%, and the transaction fee is 0.3%, then selling 0.0099 USSD tokens would result in receiving 0.0099 * (1 - 0.01 - 0.003) = 0.0096723 DAI tokens. If the price of USSD before the sale was 2 DAI, it means that we're effectively selling USSD for 0.0096723 / 0.0099 = 0.977 DAI each, which is less than their market price.

## Impact

Impacts of this vulnerability include:

Potential for arbitrage: The large price movement could be exploited by arbitrageurs, leading to a net loss for the pool.

Unstable Pool: It might lead to an imbalance between the USSD and DAI tokens in the pool, compromising the stability of the pool.

Economic Inefficiency: The operation might result in economic inefficiency due to the net loss incurred from the transaction fees and price slippage.

```solidity
    //E @audit 1e6 - 1e4 equal to 1%
    function rebalance() override public {
      uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation(); //E Price of the USSD token in terms of the other token in the pool, likely DAI
      (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
      //E if USSD < 0.99 DAI 
      if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
        // peg-down recovery
        BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
      } 
      //E if USSD > 1.01 DAI 
      else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
        // mint and buy collateral
        // never sell too much USSD for DAI so it 'overshoots' (becomes more in quantity than DAI on the pool)
        // otherwise could be arbitraged through mint/redeem
        // the execution difference due to fee should be taken into accounting too
        // take 1% safety margin (estimated as 2 x 0.5% fee)
        IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100);  
        // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
        SellUSSDBuyCollateral();
      }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Regarding this mechanism I could see 2 ways of preventing this : 
1. Implement a Slippage Protection Mechanism: To mitigate excessive price slippage, incorporate a mechanism to cap the slippage at a reasonable limit.

2. Gradual Rebalancing: Instead of rebalancing all at once, consider implementing a mechanism that gradually rebalances the pool over time, thus minimizing the price impact.
