# Lack of validation for `_pathbuy` and `_pathsell` could completely disrupt the functionality of the protocol's rebalancing process

## Summary
When a supported collateral asset is added to the protocol, the administrator is responsible for providing the `_pathbuy` and `_pathsell` byte parameters. These parameters are utilized in the future to facilitate the purchase or sell the collateral token during the rebalancing process of the USDD/DAI liquidity pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation lacks validation for the parameters `_pathbuy` and `_pathsell` to ensure their validity as correct paths. Inevitably, it is highly probable that in the future, the administrator might inadvertently provide incorrect `_pathbuy` or `_pathsell` parameters for any of the collateral tokens.

Such an occurrence would lead to a complete breakdown of the rebalance functionality. This is due to the fact that even if only one of the collateral assets has a wrong _pathbuy or _pathsell parameter, the entire transaction would fail, resulting in a revert. 
This is primarily caused by an incorrect parameter being sent to the Uniswap V3 swap function.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that in the current test file, the developer passed the `0x` parameter to both the `_pathbuy` and `_pathsell` parameters. This oversight indicates the potential occurrence of similar mistakes in the future, especially when the protocol is deployed on the mainnet. Additionally, it is important to highlight that the rebalancing method is not being adequately tested in its current test file:

## Impact
The integrity of the protocol's liquidity rebalancing and protection against depegging/overpegging could be compromised.

## Recommendation
Before adding a collateral token to the protocol, it is imperative to conduct thorough validation of both the _pathbuy and _pathsell parameters. It is crucial to ensure that these parameters represent valid Uniswap V3 paths that facilitate either the purchase or sale of the collateral token.
