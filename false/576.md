# Rebalance transaction may revert due to price difference between Chainlink and Uniswap

## Summary
Rebalance transaction may revert when protocol tries to sell collaterals and buy USSD, due to math error cause by the calculation of _amountToBuyLeftUSD_.

## Vulnerability Detail
If USSD price is lower than DAI, protocol will do rebalancing by selling collaterals for DAI and buying USSD. 
Protocol will first get [_collateralval_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L116) and then calculate [_amountToSellUnits_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L121) based on it.
```solidity
uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;
```
```solidity
uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
```
After selling, protocol will try to update [_amountToBuyLeftUSD_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L123):
```solidity
amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
```
However, protocol gets collateral price from Chainlink and sells for DAI on Uniswap, it possible that the DAI bought amount is larger than expected (due to the price diff between Chainlink and Uniswap), so _amountToBuyLeftUSD_ might be less than the DAI balance difference between before selling and after selling, meaning `amountToBuyLeftUSD < (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore)`, the transaction will revert due to math error.
Let's assume:
1. _amountToBuyLeftUSD_ is **1000e18** (1000u);
2. The collateral (WBTC) price got from Chainlink is 20000u, and protocol holds 2 WBTC token (2e8), so _collateralval_ is **40000e18** (40000u);
3. _amountToSellUnits_ should be **5e6** (2.5% * 2e8);
4. Protocol sells 5e6 wei and gets **1000e18 + 1** DAI in return;
5. Protocol tries to update _amountToBuyLeftUSD_ and transaction reverts due to **1000e18 - (1000e18 + 1)**.

## Impact
Rebalance transaction will be reverted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If _collateralval_ is larger than _amountToBuyLeftUSD_, there is no need to update _amountToBuyLeftUSD_, please consider to remove [L123]([_amountToBuyLeftUSD_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L123));
If _collateralval_ is less than or equal to _amountToBuyLeftUSD_, please consider to update _amountToBuyLeftUSD_ as below:
```solidity
uint256 diff = (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
if (amountToBuyLeftUSD >= diff)
    amountToBuyLeftUSD -= diff;
else
    amountToBuyLeftUSD = 0;
```
