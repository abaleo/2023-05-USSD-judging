# SellUSSDBuyCollateral should not sell the whole USSD contract balance fro DAI

## Summary
Function `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` is called in contract `USSDRebalancer` to control the peg of USSD to DAI. But it sells the whole balance of USSD existing in the `USSD` contract, instead of just the amount minted. 

## Vulnerability Detail
As explained in the summary, this fact opens up a price manipulation attack where an attacker can send an arbitrary amount of USSD to the USSD contract, knowing that a call to rebalance will sell too much USSD for DAI.

As we can see in the first lines of the function:
```solidity
function SellUSSDBuyCollateral() internal {
  uint256 amount = IUSSD(USSD).balanceOf(USSD);
  // sell for DAI then swap by DAI routes
  uint256 daibought = 0;
  if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
	daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
	IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount);
	daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
  } else {
	daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
	IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token1(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token0())), amount);
	daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
  }
...
```

The amount of USSD that is swapped in Uniswap for DAI is the whole balance of the contract, not the amount minted in the call to the `rebalance` function:
```solidity
...
IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100); // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
SellUSSDBuyCollateral();
...
```

## Impact
High.

## Tool used
Manual review.


## Recommendation
Make function `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` receive an `amount` parameter, to just sell the amount minted, not the whole balance.
