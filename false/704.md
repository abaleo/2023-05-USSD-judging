# The function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` would calculate the wrong amount of `DAItosell` because of the WBTC decimals

## Summary
The function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` would calculate the wrong amount of `DAItosell` because of the WBTC decimals, selling a very low amount of DAI.
## Vulnerability Detail
Function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` calculate the `DAItosell` in the case where `collateral[i].pathsell.length` is 0 like this https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L125-L127 but in the case of WBTC the `DAItosell` it will be an 1e8 based number, since `amountToBuyLeftUSD` and `collateralval` are 1e18 numbers. This would call the `UniV3SwapInput` with an 1e8 based https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L152-L158 number but since DAI has 1e18 decimals it means that the amount the DAI to be sold are less than 1 DAI.
## Impact
Using WBTC to rebalance the USSD would be almost impossible because of the decimals issue

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Take special care for WBTC since it has 8 decimals and not 18 like the other collaterals
