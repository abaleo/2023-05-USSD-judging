# Pool tokens should be validated in `USSDRebalancer::setPoolAddress` otherwise protocol accounting could be seriously affected

## Summary
Currently, there are multiple checks as to whether USSD is the Uniswap v3 pool `token0`; however, if this is not the case then the protocol assumes it must be the `token1`. This assumption cannot be made unless the pool tokens are validated when setting the pool address.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the case where the stable control role incorrectly sets the Uniswap v3 pool address - there is no guarantee that both tokens are correct. Given other mistakes in the codebase relating to incorrect addresses, this is a perfectly reasonable scenario. Therefore, the assumption that if USSD is not `token0` then it must be `token1` will not hold, but execution will continue as if this is the case. Depending on the pool supplied, this could lead to wildly over-/under-inflated values returned from calls to `USSDRebalancer::getOwnValuation` and `USSDRebalancer::getSupplyProportion`. Additionally, swap inputs in `USSDRebalancer::BuyUSSDSellCollateral` and `USSDRebalancer::SellUSSDBuyCollateral` could be seriously wrong.

## Impact
Protocol accounting will be seriously affected if an incorrect pool address is passed for the `uniPool` state variable and will very likely lead to loss of user funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate the pool tokens are indeed correct whenever `USSDRebalancer::setPoolAddress` is called.
