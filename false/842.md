# Attacker Can Make The collateralization factor 0 Hindering the overcollateralization logic

## Summary

Attacker can frontrun a rebalance transaction (peg-up recovery) and make the collateralization factor 0 
 
## Vulnerability Detail

During a peg up recovery , the rebalance() function calls `sellUSSDBuyCollateral()` here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L163 which calls `collateralFactor();` at L178 in USSD, inside the collateralFactor(); function , we return `(totalAssetsUSD * 1e6) / totalSupply();` 

Now an attacker can - 

1.) Watch the mempool for a peg up recovery transaction.

2.) Frontrun the transaction by 
     a.) minting alot of USSD using mintForToken() at L151 in USSD contract 
     b.) This will increase the totalSupply() 

3.) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L193
This line would revert because the totalSupply is very big now and fraction is rounded down.

4.) Now cf is 0 , SellUSSDBuyCollateral logic reaches this line https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L181

Since 0 will be less than flutterRatios[flutter] , this will make the first entry in the flutterRatios the flutter value which would be 
incorrect.


## Impact

Wrong flutter would be used and because of this wrong over-collateralization ratio would be used .

## Recommendation

Make sure attacker can't manipulate the rebalance tx
