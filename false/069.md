# WBGL and WBTC can be paused

## Summary

WBGL and WBTC can be paused.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the README file it is stated the following

> `we don't expect that this contract activity could be paused from outside.`

Given that the WBGL and WBTC can be paused, this would not make possible to mint them or used them to rebalance the collateral/USSD in case of a depeg event.


## Impact

If WBGL or WBTC are paused, the stability mechanisms of the protocol will stop working.

## Recommendation

Avoid using as collateral tokens that can be paused.
