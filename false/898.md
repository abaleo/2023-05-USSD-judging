# Oracles are not put into try and catch blocks,which can cause them to revert

## Summary
If the multi-sig blocks the oracle, then the price can't be computed 
## Vulnerability Detail
Since multi-sig can block PriceFeeds,it will cause them to revert
## Impact
No validation for blocking of priceFeeds which will cause reverts if the collateral tokens are using them.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
 (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Put  it into try and catch block and if it fails get another oracle, so you wouldn't have to switch oracles as often(mainnet is a lot of gas)
