# Incorrectly calculating the amount of USSD to buy from the Uniswap Pool when rebalancing

## Summary
The math to calculate the amount of USSD to buy from the Uni Pool is wrong, the order of operations as how it is defined it will first do a subtraction between two numbers that are scaled up by a different magnitude, [`USSDamount` is scaled up by `10**6`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L84) , and [`DAIamount` is scaled up by `10**18`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L85)

## Vulnerability Detail
- The order of operations, also known as the PEMDAS rule (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, and Addition and Subtraction from left to right).
- From the PEMDAS rule, the result of the [current mathematical expression to calculate the amountToBuy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L97) will be incorrectly doing a subtraction between two numbers that are scaled up by different magnitudes, which will cause the result to be different than the expected result.
- Since the computed result is forwarded to the [`BuyUSSDSellCollateral()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L109) to be used to calculate the amount of USSD to buy from the USSD/DAI pool, using a wrong value as the base amount to compute the number of tokens to buy might lead to buying more tokens than what it should be bought, causing the Pool to fall into an imbalance state, which then could be abused by users by swapping DAI and receiving more USSD than what they should receive.

## Impact
- All the calculations made on the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()`[] will be wrong since the `amountToBuy` received as a parameter will be wrong, which could eventually lead to estimating a higher amount of USSD tokens to buy from the pool which that will cause the pool to fall into an imbalance state and users can take advantage of it by swapping DAI and receiving more USSD than what they should receive if the pool wouldn't be in an imbalance state.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Make sure to normalize the magnitude of the `DAIamount` down to the scale of `10**6` (Same scale of the `USSDAmount`) before doing the subtraction between the two numbers
```solidity
function rebalance() override public {
  uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation();
  (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
  if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
    // peg-down recovery
-   BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);

+   DAIamount = (DAIamount / 1e12);
+   BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount)/2);
  } else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
    ...
  }
}
```
