# rebalance() function will always revert for values of _threshold > 1e6

## Summary
Due to a missing check for  _threshold, the rebalance() will always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following situation:

1. `setTreshold()` function is used to set `_threshold` value to `1e7` 
Note: This is **NOT** done intentionally to break the smart contract. Since the smart contract allows the` _threshold` to be set to any value hence any value has been set.

2. Now, `rebalance()` is a public function used to rebalance the pool and more importantly - this can be called by anybody.
3. As soon as `if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold)` check is performed in the function, a revert is observed because it actually evaluates to `1e6 - 1e7`. 

Hence no one will be able to call `rebalance()` function and thus rebalancing won't be possible


## Impact
No one will be able to call `rebalance()` function because it will always revert and thus rebalancing won't be possible


## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L58-L60

```solidity
    function setTreshold(uint256 _threshold) public onlyControl {
      threshold = _threshold;
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L92-L107

```solidity
    function rebalance() override public {
      uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation();
      (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
      if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
        // peg-down recovery
        BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
      } else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
        // mint and buy collateral
        // never sell too much USSD for DAI so it 'overshoots' (becomes more in quantity than DAI on the pool)
        // otherwise could be arbitraged through mint/redeem
        // the execution difference due to fee should be taken into accounting too
        // take 1% safety margin (estimated as 2 x 0.5% fee)
        IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100); // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
        SellUSSDBuyCollateral();
      }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`setTreshold()` should be updated as follows:

```solidity
    function setTreshold(uint256 _threshold) public onlyControl {
+    require(_threshold < 1e6, "Value too large");
      threshold = _threshold;
    }
```
