# By minting a large amount of USSD, the attacker can manipulate the amount of DAI that the contract swaps.

## Summary
In the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`function, the USSD held by the USSD address is calculated and swapped with DAI.
However, the USSD can be minted in any quantity by anyone at any time for  USSD address.
Therefore, by front-running the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` transaction and minting USSD, the amount of DAI to be exchanged can be skewed.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`, `amount = IUSSD(USSD).balanceOf(USSD)` is calculated. This is used as a parameter for swap and is exchanged for DAI.
By front-running and minting a large amount of USSD to IUSSD(USSD), the exchange volume can be significantly skewed.
## Impact
Unexpected volume will be swapped with DAI, distorting the price significantly
