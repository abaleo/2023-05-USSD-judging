# `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` relies on the settings and assumption about the value of certain collateral

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function, it is important that the first item in the `collateral` list is DAI. Otherwise, when the for loop reaches DAI, `DAItosell` will be overridden.

Furthermore, the function assumes that DAI and only DAI has a `pathsell.length == 0`.

However, these assumptions cannot be guaranteed when setting the `collateral` list.

When `collateralval <= amountToBuyLeftUSD` and `collateralval >= amountToBuyLeftUSD / 20`, it should not assume that the collateral cannot be the `baseAsset` DAI. In cases where it is, the transaction will revert as DAI's `pathsell` will be empty, causing L135 to revert.

## Impact

Malfunction of `rebalance()`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The assumptions should be checked and handled.
