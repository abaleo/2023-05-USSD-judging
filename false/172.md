# Initial mint does not correspond with Whitepaper.

## Summary
Initial mint does not correspond with Whitepaper.
## Vulnerability Detail
> USSD coin is ’initialized’ with one-time minting of 1000 USSD, taking 1000
DAI as collateral. This 1000 USSD would allow to create a pool USSD/DAI to
have initial liquidity.

The Whitepaper states that USSD would be initialized with a one-time minting of 1000 USSD but the implementation mints 10k USSD.

## Impact
discrepancy between whitepaper and implementation.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L42
```solidity
_mint(msg.sender, 10_000 * 1e6);
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Address the discrepancy between whitepaper and implementation.
