# Using the collateral assets' oracle price at 100% of its value to mint USSD without a fee can be used for arbitrage.

## Summary

Allowing the users to mint USSD using the collateral assets, at 100% of its value based on the oracle price without a fee can easily be exploited by the arbitragers.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Oracle price can not be trusted as the real-time price.

For example, the BTC/USD and ETH/USD price feeds on miannet have a "Deviation threshold" of 0.5%, meaning that the price will only be updated once the price movement exceeds 0.5% within the heartbeat period.

Say if the previous price point for WETH is 1000 USD, the price will only be updated once the price goes up to more than 1005 USD or down to less than 995 USD.

## Impact

When the market price of WETH is lower than the oracle price, it is possible to mint 1000 USSD by using 1 WETH and selling it to DAI, causing the quality of the collateral for USSD to continuously decrease and the value to be leaked to the arbitragers.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a minting fee of 0.5% to 1% (should be higher than the deviation).
