# USSD.initialize does not set admin role as admin of STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE

## Summary
adminRole for `STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE` is not set.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L39
The role `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is set for msg.sender.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L53
Modifier checks if msg.sender has the role `STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE`

Meaning, to be able to call the functions with the modifier you need that role.
To assign that role to someone via `AccessControlUpgradeable.grantRole(STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE)`, you need to pass `onlyRole(getRoleAdmin(STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE)`.

`getRoleAdmin(STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE)` checks `_roles[role].adminRole`
Since `AccessControlUpgradeable._setRoleAdmin` has not been called to set `_roles[role].adminRole`, the check will fail.

This means that no one can be set as `STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE`
## Impact
All functions with `onlyControl` modifier are unavailable.

## Recommendation
Call _setRoleAdmin in initializer and set adminrole of  `STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE` to DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
