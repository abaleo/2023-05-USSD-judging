# Collateral list can cause DOS

## Summary
The USSD contract holds all the collateral, as the contract it's performing operations with the collateral, because the collaterals are saved inside a list ( array ), if the collateral list becomes to big, it will DOS ( through a revert ) when the contract it's trying to perform it's basic operations. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The collaterals addresses that are used by the USSD contract are stored inside the [collateral variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L73) as this variable it's not a fixed size array, and any collateral can be added to the list through the [addCollateral function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L84), basically collateral array can grow so big that it will cause a revert inside the contract when it is iterated putting the contract in a dos state. All the critical operations like [rebalancing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#LL196C5-L196C5), [mintForTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L151) and so on.. iterate through the collateral list to gather data to perform their execution putting the contract in a state where he is not able to perform it's most critical operations. 

## Impact
DOS (Revert ) over contract critical operations

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Holds the collateral tokens in a fixed size array to not being able to add more then 5 collateral ever.
2. Whitelist the collateral tokens using a mapper.
