# Deprecated `approve()` function

## Summary
Deprecated approve() function

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
contracts/USSD.sol:
  241  
  242:     function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
  243:         IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
  244:             address(uniRouter),
  245:             0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
  246:         );
  247:     }
  248  }
```

## Impact
This is a well know vulnerability around the usage of **approve** with ERC20 tokens.

An example for clarification:

- Alice grants permission to Bob to transfer a specific amount (N>0) of Alice's tokens by using the `approve` function and passing Bob's address and N as the arguments.

- At a later point, Alice decides to change the number of tokens Bob is allowed to transfer to a new value (M>0), and calls the `approve` function **again** with Bob's address and M as the arguments.

- Bob notices the second transaction before it is confirmed (by observing the mempool) and promptly sends a transferFrom transaction to move N of Alice's tokens to another account.

- If Bob's `transferFrom` transaction is confirmed before Alice's second approval transaction (Bob ensures this by spending more gas than Alice does for her transaction changing the approval), Bob will successfully transfer N tokens and gain permission to transfer an additional M tokens.

- This allows Bob to transfer N+M tokens, even though Alice never intended to allow Bob to transfer such a large amount. Alice just wanted bob to transfer M tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
approve which is subject to a known front-running attack and failing for certain token implementations that do not return a boolean value. Consider using safeApprove instead (or better: safeIncreaseAllowance()/safeDecreaseAllowance())
