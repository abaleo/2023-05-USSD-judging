# getCollateralIndex should revert if token not found in collaterals array

## Summary
In `USSD` contract, function `getCollateralIndex` is supposed to return the index in the `collateral` array that corresponds to the token address passed as parameter. If the token address does not exist in the array, the function returns 0 as the index in the array, which is wrong and could lead to future attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
`getCollateralIndex` is only called in function `calculateMint`. If the token address passed as parameter does not exist in the array of collateral, `calculateMint` would return a wrong amount, calculated using the price of the first collateral in the array (index 0) and the decimals of the token passed in as parameter:
```solidity
function calculateMint(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
	uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)].oracle.getPriceUSD();
	return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());
}
```

Function `calculateMint` is only called inside the project in function `mintForToken`, which is already protected from non added collateral tokens with the first line in its body:
```solidity
require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token");
```


## Impact
Medium, it has not direct impact at the moment, but the function does not work properly and could cause trouble if used elsewhere in the future.

## Tool used
Manual review.


## Recommendation
Revert after the `for` loop of `getCollateralIndex` function, as this means the token was not found in the array.
