# Chainlink's `latestRoundData` may return stale or incorrect results

## Summary

No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price. The functions rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, sometimes can lead to fund loss. Check should be applied on Chainlink's latestRoundData() function to ensure that the latest answer is recent enough to be used.

## Vulnerability Detail

USSD use oracle wrapper `getPriceUSD()` call out to an oracle with `latestRoundData()` to get the price of some token (DAI, WBTC, WETH) and there is no check for round completeness, this could lead to stale prices being used. For example, if the market price of the token drops rapidly and Chainlink's feed does not get updated in a timely manner, the smart contract will continue to believe the token is worth more than the market value.

## Impact

lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price.

## Code Snippet

sample code from WBTC oracle wrapper.

```solidity
File: StableOracleWBTC.sol
21:     function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
22:         //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
23:         (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
24:         // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD
25:         return uint256(price) * 1e10;
26:     }
```

## Recommendation

Consider adding the missing freshness check for stale price, for example, add `require(answeredInRound >= roundID)` as an additional check.
