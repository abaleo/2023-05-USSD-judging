# Missing crucial modifier on `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions

## Summary

Missing crucial modifier on `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `USSD` contract, there are functions which open for public, `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer`. This basically will mint to and burn the token from `USSD` contract itself. 

Either this is overlooked by the USSD team, or intended-low-hanging fruits, and it's unlikely a protocol design (because it can be abusive thing to do, for example to mint a large amount supply, which then affecting the `rebalance()` function)

## Impact

Anyone can front-run any rebalance, and increase the supply amount, resulting invalid calculation on rebalance, especially when the `uint256 amount = IUSSD(USSD).balanceOf(USSD);` being used. 

Another case, it will make `collateralFactor` to be 0, because the large `totalSupply`

## Recommendation

Add modifer `onlyBalancer` to the functions.
