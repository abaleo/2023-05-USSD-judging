# Malicious user can crash USSD price with zero cost to malicious user

## Summary

A malicious user can force the USSD rebalancing mechanism to purchase the majority of DAI from the uniswap USSD:DAI pool at zero cost to the malicious user. This will result in the price of USSD to drop way below peg as there will be a ton of USSD and little DAI in the pool. This depegging will cause issues for any DeFi project relying on the uniswapv3 oracle for price (as a price drop can be used to drain funds from other protocols integrating USSD). This is extra problematic because, in conjunction with no uniswap slippage enforcement, the rebalancer can be unable to re-purchase the funds thus creating a sustained price drop that can affect TWAP oracles build on the uniswapv3 pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

This vulnerability is messy because the code allows for a malicious user to perform this attack at zero cost due to a lack of restriction on who can call `mintRebalancer()`, but, even with that fixed there is still a vulnerability in how the code is written.

In the USSD.sol contract, the [`mintRebalancer()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204) and `burnRebalancer()` are not restricted to be called just by the USSDRebalancer, meaning, anyone can force the USSD contract to mint and/or burn more USSD balance to itself.

This becomes problematic when interacting with the USSDRebalancer's balancing logic. The USSDRebalancer's price reducer logic path [uses the USSD's balance of USSD](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#LL164C52-L164C52) to signal how much DAI needs to be re-purchased from the DAI:USSD pool in order to reduce the price of USSD.

The following steps can be used to crash the pool's price of USSD:
1. Protocol is in state where USSD price needs to be lowered (this will happen naturally as people use the protocol)
1. Malicious user calls `mintRebalancer()` to raise USSD's balance of USSD
1. Malicious user (or anyone) calls `USSDRebalancer.rebalance()`
1. USSDRebalancer mis-calculates how much DAI needs to be re-purchased and overshoots its target and crashes price of USSD
1. [Extra chaos under certain conditions]  USSDRebalacner cannot rebalance pool because collateral was repurchased with too much slippage, making price difference stick

Even with the `mintRebalancer()` function properly restricted to just USSDRebalancer, the USSDRebalancer can still be forced to purchase more DAI than necessary. A malicious user, at a cost to themselves, would transfer USSD to the USSD contract, and the USSDRebalancing logic would still over-correct the price of the DAI:USSD pool. This attack could be valid if the user was shorting the price of USSD somewhere else in Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem where the short return would be high enough to cover the costs of the initial USSD transfer.

## Impact

The pool's price of USSD will drop, causing chaos for any DeFi protocols integrating USSD with the price sourced from the uniswapV3 pool. 


## Code Snippet

[Here is a test file](https://gist.github.com/Lilyjjo/ecf179cb1abc48a973c05e73fa282030) showcasing the vulnerability. It's a gist because it is too long to put here due to the needed setup. It showcases the variant of using `mintRebalancer()` to raise USSD's balance of USSD.

Relevant logs from running test case:
```text
!!! Start of Problematic Logic !!!
DAI balance of USSD/DAI POOL at 0xcF547F4c5f4eDe4744EFFC468dB9C479601c938c: 9999999999999999000001
USSD balance of USSD/DAI POOL is 10000000000
starting price: 1000001
User swaps 100 DAI for USSD to raise price to rebalancing threshold
end price: 1020090
Have malicious user call mintRebalancer() with 2000000 USSD
Run rebalancing logic
post rebalancing price w/ malicous mint: 24
Run rebalancing logic again to try to recover price
post rebalancing price: 24
see that price is still too low :(
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not use USSD's balance of USSD to determine how much DAI to buy back from the DAI:USSD pool. This is unsafe with and without the lack of restrictions on who can call `mintRebalancer()`. Instead, just pass the amount of USSD needed as a variable.
