# `mintRebalancer()` wrongly reduced by 1% inside rebalance process

## Summary

Inside rebalance process, when the rebalancer need to mint `USSD`, `mintRebalancer()` is called but unnecessarily reduced by 1% (for fee). This fee cut is placed in wrong place and can cause rebalance processed with incorrect amount, or revert caused by lack of fund for fee. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside `rebalance()` call, if `mintRebalancer()` with reduce the value by 1% as input for fee. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L104

```solidity
        // never sell too much USSD for DAI so it 'overshoots' (becomes more in quantity than DAI on the pool)
        // otherwise could be arbitraged through mint/redeem
        // the execution difference due to fee should be taken into accounting too
        // take 1% safety margin (estimated as 2 x 0.5% fee)
        IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100); // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
```

But fee should not deduced from mint amount, instead should be from the amount of USSD that will be swapped. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L163-L175

```solidity
    function SellUSSDBuyCollateral() internal {
      // @audit - fee should be deduced from this amount
      uint256 amount = IUSSD(USSD).balanceOf(USSD);
      // sell for DAI then swap by DAI routes
      uint256 daibought = 0;
      if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount);
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
      } else {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token1(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token0())), amount);
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
      }
     ...
}
```

## Impact

This fee cut is placed in wrong place and can cause rebalance processed with incorrect amount, or revert caused by lack of fund for fee.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Move the fee cut calculation from `mintRebalancer()` to ` SellUSSDBuyCollateral()`, when calculating `amount` to swap : 

```solidity
        IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2); // don't cut for fee here
```

```solidity
    function SellUSSDBuyCollateral() internal {
      // @audit - fee should be deduced from here
      uint256 amount = (IUSSD(USSD).balanceOf(USSD) * 99 / 100);
      // sell for DAI then swap by DAI routes
      uint256 daibought = 0;
      if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount);
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
      } else {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token1(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token0())), amount);
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
      }
     ...
}
```
