# Incorrect Initialization of ethOracle in StableOracleDAI Contract

## Summary

In StableOracleDAI contract constructor, there the initialization of the ethOracle contract address which is being incorrectly set to the zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract StableOracleDAI includes an initialization of ethOracle inside the constructor. However, the address is hard-coded to be the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).

```solidity
ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000); // TODO: WETH oracle price
```

The zero address is typically used in Ethereum to indicate an uninitialized or non-existing address, and as such does not contain a deployed contract.

The ethOracle contract is meant to provide the price of ETH in USD, and therefore any interaction with it in its current state would fail, because there is no contract deployed at the zero address.

## Impact

The consequence is Non-functional price oracle for ETH, which will affect the overall operation of the StableOracleDAI contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the ethOracle address is properly set upon contract deployment.
