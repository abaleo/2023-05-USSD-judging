# `rebalance` makes false assumptions about pool compositions

## Summary
When doing rebalance, the amount to rebalance is determined by the diff in tokens in the USSD/DAI pool. This is not the same as the price difference between the two.

## Vulnerability Detail
When doing a rebalance the token balances of the pool is queried:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L83-L85
```solidity
File: USSDRebalancer.sol

83:    function getSupplyProportion() public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
84:      uint256 vol1 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token0()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));
85:      uint256 vol2 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token1()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));
```

This is later used to determine how much USSD is going to be rebalalanced:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L94-L105

```solidity
File: USSDRebalancer.sol

 94:      (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
 95:      if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
 96:        // peg-down recovery
 97:        BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
 98:      } else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
			// ...
104:        IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100); // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
105:        SellUSSDBuyCollateral();
```

The issue here is that the amounts are not representative of the price difference, look at the USDC/DAI pool as an example:
https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x5777d92f208679db4b9778590fa3cab3ac9e2168

At time of writing, the liquidity is split 49m DAI, 60m USDC, but the price is trading at 1:1.

This could also cause the rebalance to fail, because just because `USSDamount - DAIamount` or `DAIamount - USSDamount` might underflow.

Even worse, this could be used by an attacker with a flash loan to inflate the difference and cause a lot more tokens than needed to be minted, simply by adding liquidity in a tick that isn't traded.

## Impact
An attacker could cause a lot more USSD and collateral to be traded than intended.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the price is algorithmic you can calculate the trade needed to cause a certain price movement based on current tick and liquidity in those ticks.
