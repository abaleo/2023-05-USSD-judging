# Incorrect use of If statement results in always 'trying' to buy DAI

## Summary
There is an if statement that checks if the current collateral is not either of the tokens in the USSD/DAI pool. However it will always pass since one of the two statements will be true. 

## Vulnerability Detail
USSD is minted in `rebalancer` if USSD is worth more than 1 dai - threshold. This is sold on the uniswap pool for dai in the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` method. At the end there is a loop which that buys dai using each collateral token. It does that by the `path` that is given when adding the collateral via the `addCollateral` function in the `USSD ` contract. 

The idea of the check is to ignore the collateral which is `dai`  as it has been bought. Since there's no path for dai as to buy dai the function will always revert when uniswap tries to do the swap.

## Impact
`SellUSSDBuyCollateral` will always revert, the protocol is unable to rebalance itself correctly. It bricks the core functionality.
## Code Snippet

[Link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L199)
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++) {
        uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;
        if (collateralval * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[i].ratios[flutter]) {
          if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {
            // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
          }
        }
      }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the if statement to use the && instead of ||
```diff
- if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) 
+ if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() && collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) 
```
