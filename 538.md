# USSD accepts 100% slippage when swapping colletaral in `UniV3SwapInput` making it vulnerable to front-running attacks

## Summary

The `UniV3SwapInput` function, used by the rebalancer to buy or sell collateral, accepts a slippage of 100% due to setting `amountOutMinimum` to 0. This high slippage acceptance poses a risk as it makes the function vulnerable to front-running attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `UniV3SwapInput` function in the USSD system is used for swapping tokens within the UniswapV3 pool. The function takes an `_amountOutMinimum` parameter, which is set to 0, allowing the function to accept any amount of tokens as a return for a swap, including a return of 0. This is equivalent to accepting 100% slippage.

In a high volatility environment or a situation where there's a large price difference between the swap tokens, an attacker could anticipate a `UniV3SwapInput` transaction in the mempool and front-run it with a transaction that drastically changes the price of the tokens in the pool. The front-running transaction would be mined first, causing the `UniV3SwapInput` transaction to swap tokens at an unfavorable rate, leading to financial loss.

This vulnerability is documented in the Uniswap v3 documentation: [Swap Input Parameters](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/swaps/single-swaps#swap-input-parameters).

## Impact

This vulnerability could result in a significant financial loss for the USSD system. An attacker could manipulate the token prices in the pool to their advantage, causing the USSD system to buy or sell tokens at a highly unfavorable rate.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's strongly recommended to add a parameter for `amountOutMinimum` or establish a reasonable minimum limit to protect against possible front-running attacks.
