# DAIEthOracle and staticOracleUniV3 variables are set to the wrong address

## Summary
`DAIEthOracle` from `StableOracleDAI` and `staticOracleUniV3` from `StableOracleWBGL` don't implement the `IStaticOracle` interface.

## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see in the code snippets below, the `DAIEthOracle` and `staticOracleUniV3` are equal to `0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e`, which is a `UniswapV3Pool` contract. It doesn't have the `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod()` function used in `getPriceUSD()` in both contracts.

See my another issue with `DAIEthOracle`, it is probably should be merged with this one.

## Impact
`StableOracleDAI` and `StableOracleWBGL` don't work as intended and will throw at every call to `getPriceUSD()`
