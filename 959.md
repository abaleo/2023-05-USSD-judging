# rebalance() could be manipulated by flash loan

## Summary
The `rebalance()` function is based on [getSupplyProportion()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L83) which uses the token0 and token1 balances of `uniPool`. However, the balances could be easily manipulated by flash loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `uniPool.flash()` function allows users to loan an arbitrary amount of token0/token1 out, which is a built-in feature of [UniswapV3Pool](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/UniswapV3Pool#flash). If the bad actor invokes [rebalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L92) inside the flash loan callback, the `USSDamount` and `DAIamount` could be manipulated. Therefore, the `rebalance()`ed result would not be the expected result. Bad actors can actually buy/sell any amount of USSD.

## Impact
Since the buying/selling operations of the USSDRebalancer could be manipulated, bad actors could make profit from arbitrage.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function getSupplyProportion() public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
      uint256 vol1 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token0()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));
      uint256 vol2 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token1()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));
      if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        return (vol1, vol2);
      }
      return (vol2, vol1);
    }

    function rebalance() override public {
      uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation();
      (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
      if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
        // peg-down recovery
        BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
      } else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
        // mint and buy collateral
        // never sell too much USSD for DAI so it 'overshoots' (becomes more in quantity than DAI on the pool)
        // otherwise could be arbitraged through mint/redeem
        // the execution difference due to fee should be taken into accounting too
        // take 1% safety margin (estimated as 2 x 0.5% fee)
        IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100); // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
        SellUSSDBuyCollateral();
      }
    }
```

## Recommendation
Don't use the balances which could be easily manipulated.
