# Infinite minting & burning of USSD token due to missing Access Control

## Summary

The functions  `mintRebalancer()` and `burnRebalancer()` are public functions with no access control, so anyone can mint/burn as they like.  

## Vulnerability Detail

The functions  `mintRebalancer()` and `burnRebalancer()` in the `USSD.sol` contract are missing the `onlyControl` modifier, which means anyone can freely mint and burn USSD tokens. 



## Impact

Since the balance of USSD tokens held by the USSD contract is used as a critical variable in the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` function to determine the amount of tokens which need to be swapped to DAI, sufficiently increasing the token balance of the contract through `mintRebalancer()` would break the USSD/DAI swap function and thus make the protocol be unable to function.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the  `onlyControl` modifier to both functions.
