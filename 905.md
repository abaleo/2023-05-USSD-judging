# WBGL pool can be manipulated

## Summary
WBGL pool can be manipulated because it's a small pool the price 
## Vulnerability Detail
The current liquidity is 22k all together which can be easily manipulated with flash loans or big loans. causing the incorrect price to be computed.
## Impact
It's medium because it's very unlikely with a 10-minute Twap which would make this manipulation more gas costly but if the attacker can cause the price to become `1 wei` or smaller value,WBGL will be overvalued which an attacker can take advantage of, and mint more USSD.Paying off the gas cost of the Twap.
