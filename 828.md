# `StableOracleDAI` is improperly implemented.

## Summary

DAI/ETH Feed has 18 decimal places, but the current implementation mistakes it with WETH/USD and believes it has 8 decimal places, resulting in an incorrect price for DAI token.

## Vulnerability Detail

DAI/ETH Feed (0x773616e4d11a78f511299002da57a0a94577f1f4) has 18 decimal places, indicating the amount of ETH that can be exchanged for one DAI.

See: https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/dai-eth.

However, the current implementation has mistaken DAI/ETH with WETH/USD and believes that the decimal places for DAI/ETH is 8. As a result, `StableOracleDAI.sol#getPriceUSD()` returns an incorrect price for the DAI token.
