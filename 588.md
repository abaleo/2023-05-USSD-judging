# Transfer and approve don't work for some tokens, they either revert or fail silently

## Summary
Certain tokens, do not return a boolean value for their approve functions. Causing these function to revert or fail silently.
## Vulnerability Detail
To handle approvals for these tokens effectively, you have two options. 
 - Firstly, you can utilize the safeApprove method. 
 - Alternatively, you can invoke the approve method using a more broadly scoped interface.
## Impact

## Code Snippet
[contracts/USSD.sol/L242-L247](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L242-L247)
```jsx
    function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
            address(uniRouter),
            0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        );
    }
```
