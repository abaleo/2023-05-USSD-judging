# `USSDRebalancer.sol` is easy is manipulate due to how how it calculates price in `getOwnValuation` function

## Summary
The `getOwnValuation()` function is vulnerable to price manipulation, which can lead to inaccurate price estimations and financial losses. The vulnerability arises due to the reliance on the Uniswap V3 `slot0()` without considering the possibility of price manipulation by attackers.

## Vulnerability Detail
```Solidity
function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
      if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
      } else {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18) >> (96 * 2);
        // flip the fraction
        price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
      }
    }
```

`getOwnValuation()` uses the `uniPool.slot0` to determine the number of tokens it has in it's position. [slot0](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/interfaces/pool/IUniswapV3PoolState#slot0) is the most recent data point and can easily be manipulated.

Attackers can leverage flash swaps to borrow assets from the pool, manipulate the square root price through a series of trades, and then return the borrowed assets. This manipulation impacts subsequent price calculations, including those performed in the `getOwnValuation()` function.

## Impact
The impact could be significant. If an attacker is able to manipulate the price of the token in the Uniswap pool, they could then buy or sell the token at an unfair price. This could lead to users and protocol to loose money

## Recommendation
Use a TWAP instead of slot0.
