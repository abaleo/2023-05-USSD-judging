# Initializing of implementation contracts is missing

## Summary

The USSD deploys a few contracts in an upgradeable fashion with a proxy pattern. The implementation contracts in such a setup should not be forgotton to be initialized. Depending on the proxy setup this can lead to a severe attack vector.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `UUSD.sol` and `USSDRebalancer.sol` contracts are deployed with a proxy pattern.

For both contracts the `initialize` function is used to unitialize the proxy state variables:

- https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L38

What seems to have been overlooked is that it is recommended to define a constructor for this kind of implementation contracts calling the `_disableInitializers()` function to avoid unexpected initializations.

## Impact

Uninitialized contracts can be initialized by anyone. Depending on the proxy setup this can have severe consequences.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include a constructor in each each upgradeable contract like this:

```solidity
constructor() {
  _disableInitializers();
}
```
