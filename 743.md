# Reliance on spot price and spot volume, allows anyone to manipulate rebalance

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
USSD allows anyone to rebalance to keep the peg of USSD close to 1e6, 
rebalance does either buying USSD or selling USSD, the choice of which action to execute depends on the output of `getOwnValuation` and the swap amount is dependent on `getSupplyProportion`.
However, since both `getOwnValuation` and `getSupplyProportion`, are derived from the spot condition of the pool, it allows anyone to manipulate the rebalance decisions and extract value.

## Impact
Anyone can manipulate the rebalance decision (to sell or to buy) easily, take the role of another party for swap action, extract value
