# Incorrect assumption on call reverting when DAI is not purchased

## Summary
Incorrect assumption on call reverting when DAI is not purchased leads to execution continuing when DAI has not been purchased

## Vulnerability Detail
In L170 and L174 the previous DAI balance is stored in `daibought` and then subtracted from the current DAI balance. This subtraction will not revert if no DAI has been bought as assumed by the comments, it will result in a value of 0

## Impact
An attempt to rebalance and sell USSD which does not result in DAI being purchased will be valid and not revert as desired

## Code Snippet
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L167>
```solidity
if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
    daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
    IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount);
    daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
} else {
    daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
    IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token1(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token0())), amount);
    daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check that the DAI balance has increased, ideally by at least a desired amount
