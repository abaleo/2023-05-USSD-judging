# Wrong address for `BTC/USD` Chainlink aggregator contract

## Summary

Wrong address for `BTC/USD` Chainlink aggregator contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the constructor of `StableOracleWBTC.sol` `priceFeed` is initialized with the address `0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419`. This is the address of the **ETH/USD** aggregator, not the **WBTC/USD**.

This is a clear mistake, as in the comments we can read:
```js
/*
    wbtc 0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599;
    chainlink btc/usd priceFeed 0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c;
*/
```
However, that is not the correct address either, as it is for the **BTC/USD** price feed and not **WBTC/USD**, and the prices of BTC and WBTC might not be the same.


## Impact

Calls to `StableOracleWBTC.sol:getPriceUSD()` will return the wrong price, which might lead to mint and rebalance functionalities to work erratically and USSD being depegged.
