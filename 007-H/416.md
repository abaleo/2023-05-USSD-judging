# Division before multiplication could lead to precision loss


## Summary
When performing calculations in solidity, it's essential to consider the possibility of precision loss. As Solidity does not handle fractional values natively, any decimal places in a uint256 variable will be truncated.
There are many instances where the protocol is doing division before multiplication resulting in precision loss as mentioned below.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown in following snippet , multiplication of assetPrice and amount is divided by 1e18, which then again is multiplied by USSD decimal(), leading to considerable loss in precision.

There are many instances of the same pattern being followed as mentioned in code snippet section.

## Impact
Precision loss.
