# Minting USSD with small DAI amounts may result in zero USSD

## Summary

When calculating how much USSD a user receives for depositing DAI, the precision is reduced from 18 to 6 decimals. Therefore, if a user deposits an amount lower than 1e12 DAI (0.000001 DAI), they will receive zero USSD due to precision loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

When depositing DAI to mint USSD, the amount of USSD received is calculated using the `calculateMint` function.
        
        stableCoinAmount = calculateMint(token, tokenAmount);

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L163

In `calculateMint`, the amount returned is calculated as follows:

        return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L172

Letâ€™s examine the decimal conversion: (((assetPrice (`1e18`) * _amount(`eX`)) / `1e18`) * (10 ** decimals()(`e6`))) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals()(`1e18`));

We have e18 + eX - 1e18 + 1e6 - 1e18 = 0 when eX = e12. 

So if `_amount` has decimals less than e12, the calculation will round down to zero. It means that if the amount of DAI is less than `1e12`, the amount of USSD minted is zero.

## Impact

The user loses their DAI amount and gets no USSD in return.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add logic that if users send an amount of DAI less than 1e12 then the `mintForToken` function will revert.
