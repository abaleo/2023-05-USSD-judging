# The returned amount in USSD.calculateMint() is scaled up by the wrong magnitude which will lead to users receiving more USSD than the real USD value of the collateral that they are depositing

## Summary
The mathematical formula to calculate the amount of USSD to be minted in exchange for an amount of collateral is wrong, and **for all the valid collaterals that use a different decimal than 18 (initially only WBTC), the number of tokens to be minted will be returned scaled up by the wrong scale**, ***which will lead to users receiving more USSD than the value of the collateral they are depositing.***

## Vulnerability Detail
By doing the maths behind the mathematical formula used to calculate the number of USSD tokens to be minted in exchange for a certain amount of valid collateral we get:
- Take into account that the variables used in the mathematical formula are scaled up by the next magnitudes, respectively:
  - [`assetPrice` is scaled up by `10**18`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L171)
  - [`decimals()` will return the number of decimals that the USSD token has](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L45-L47), which is 6.
  - `tokenDecimals` will be scaled up by a different magnitude depending on the decimals of the collateral that is been used for minting, DAI,WETH & WBGL are scaled up by `10**18`, & [WBTC is scaled up by `10**8`](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599#readContract#F4)

- **When the collateral's decimals are set to 18 (DAI, WETH & WBJL), the formula works like a charm**
  - `((10**18)*(10**18) / (10**18)) * (10**6)] / (10**18) ==> [((10**36)/(10**18)) * (10**6)] / (10**18)  =>  [(10**18) * (10**6)] / (10**18)  => (10**24) / (10**18)  =>  (10**6)`

- But **the issue occurs when the collateral's decimals are set to a different value than 18**, ***for example, 8 (WBTC)***, **the formula doesn't work and returns a value scaled up by a greater magnitude than what it really should be.**
  - `[((10**18)*(10**18) / (10**18)) * (10**6)] / (10**8)  ==> [((10**36)/(10**18)) * (10**6)] / (10**8)   =>  [(10**18) * (10**6)] / (10**8)  => (10**24) / (10**8)    =>  (10**16)`

## Impact
if users use WBTC to mint USSD, they will get a huge bigger amount of USSD tokens than what they really should receive, which then the users could use those extra tokens to sell them for DAI on the USSD/DAI pool, and slowly draining the collateral's value of the rest of the users by minting WBTC for USSD and then swapping the received USSD for DAI.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Make sure to update the mathematical formula, so that it returns the correct number of tokens to be minted scaled up by the correct magnitude (10**6), no matter the decimals of the collateral being deposited.
- Update the formula as follows, in this way, the magnitude of the returned value will always be correctly scaled up by 10**6

```solidity
function calculateMint(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
    uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)].oracle.getPriceUSD();
-   return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());
+   return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / 1e18
}
```

- If you may be wondering why dividing by `10**18`, the answer is that [`assetPrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#LL171C1-L171C90) & [`_amount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/test/USSDsimulator.test.js#L334) are scaled up by `10**18`, and only one of the two is being canceled, there is still pending to cancel the magnitude of the other one, which is up by `10**18`, that is why is required to divide by `10**18`, instead of the tokenDecimals
