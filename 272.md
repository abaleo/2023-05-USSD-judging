# lack of expiration timestamp check in USSD.sol.UniV3SwapInput()

## Summary
The swap transaction from [USSD.sol.UniV3SwapInput()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L227) lack of expiration timestamp control, pending transaction to be unexpected executed.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
the deadline check is commented, which means the deadline check is disabled!

## Impact
AMMs provide their users with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as swaps or adding and removing liquidity. The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter (for example see Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3). If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend the protocol use block.timstamp for swapping deadline.
