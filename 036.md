# Anyone can mint and burn any USSD amount

## Summary
Any amount of USSD can be minted or burned free of cost.

## Vulnerability Detail
USSD has these [two functions](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-L210):
```solidity
function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
    _mint(address(this), amount);
}

function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
    _burn(address(this), amount);
}
```

These functions don't have any access control guards and can be called by anyone.

## Impact
High. This amount can only be minted or burned for the USSD contract, it will lead to a change in total supply of USSD leading to a change in `collateralFactor` and will lead to an incorrect rebalancing.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
    _mint(address(this), amount);
}

function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
    _burn(address(this), amount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `onlyBalancer` modifier to `mintRebalancer()` and `burnRebalancer()` functions.
