# The `lastCompletedMigration` can be set by anyone who is not `owner` which will lead lack of `Persistent interdependence`.

## Summary
Anyone that is not the owner can call the `setCompleted` function to manipulate the  `lastCompletedMigration`  due to the `restricted()` modifier doesn't work as expected by the developers.
## Vulnerability Detail
Although the `Migrations` contract is not necessarily stated as in scope, and this submission might not reach the developers, it is said in the contract that.
```solidity
/*NOTE: Migrations contract implements Truffle interface for marking last completed migration,
        but also is enhanced to store (retrievable only by deployer) information map, used for
        retrieving addresses of deployed contracts for providing persistent interdependence.

        Therefore, keeping address of contract in build json for Truffle for every network is crucial
        to keep things consistent.
*/
```
meaning this contract helps in keeping things consistent in the protocol as a whole, 
the issue arises from the fact that the `restricted()` modifier is appended to the `setCompleted` to insure that only the owner would be able to set the `lastCompletedMigration` to store and keep track of information map, but the modifier doesn't implement that idea'
```solidity
    modifier restricted() {
        if (msg.sender == owner) _;
    }
```
as seen above, that check doesn't prevent anybody apart from the owner from calling a function with this modifier, I did a test on remix.ide for this and was able to call the `setCompleted` function with any other address, the result is below.
```remix
	true Transaction mined and execution succeed
transaction hash	0x3114c1e2e82177ad175075d35097bfa31296c28bb1a886562eea55fe75c51e81
from	0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db
to	Migrations.setCompleted(uint256) 0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138
```
the transaction succeeded although that address wasn't the owner's.
## Impact
The consistency of the protocol might be corrupted as any attacker aware of this can manipulate the `lastCompletedMigration` with little or no cost.

## Tool used
 Remix.IDE
Manual Review and  Remix.IDE

## Recommendation
rewrite the modifier like this instead.
```solidity
   modifier restricted() {
       require(msg.sender == owner, "not owner");
        _;
    }
```
As I have tested it and the call to the function `setCompleted` fails if it is called by anyone who is not the owner.
```remix
false Transaction mined but execution failed
