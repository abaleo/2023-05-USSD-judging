# Protocol uses wrong address across its contracts

## Summary

The protocol uses wrong addresses across its contracts

## Vulnerability Detail

### 1.- StableOracleWBTC.sol:

The [StableOracleWBTC.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol) contract uses the Chainlink WETH / USD price feed instead of the WBTC / USD. 

[Reference](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses)

#### Impact

It will cause WBTC to be priced as WETH when minting USSD using WBTC as collateral, which will be a loss for the minter.

### 2.- StableOracleDAI.sol

The [StableOracleDAI.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol) contract declares a variable named `DAIEthOracle` and is assigned the address: `0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e`

That address corresponds to the following [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e) on Etherscan which is a UniswapV3 Pool of wBGL and wETH, which apart of not being the DAI /  wETH pool, it does not have the function `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod`.

Also the `ethOracle` is left as the zero address and no function exists in the contract to change its value later.

#### Impact

The call to `getPriceUSD()` will simply fail since the given address, apart of not being related to DAI, does not conform to the `IStaticOracle` interface declared.

### 3.- StableOracleWBGL.sol

The [StableOracleWBGL.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBGL.sol) contract declares that the variable `staticOracleUniV3` has an interface of `IStaticOracle` but then the `staticOracleUniV3` variable is assigned the following address: `0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e` which is a [UniswapV3 Pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e) of wBGL and wETH that does not conform to the `IStaticOracle` interface nor have a function called `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod`.

#### Impact

The call to `getPriceUSD()` will simply fail since the given address does not conform to the `IStaticOracle` interface declared.

## Impact

See Vulnerability Detail. 

These errors are not raised during the tests because the `SimOracle.sol` contract is used for test purposes instead of the contracts above mentioned. Quoting the `SimOracle.sol` contract:

```solidity
/// @notice oracle for simulation/test with direct price setting
```

This can be seen directly on the tests:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the incorrect addresses to the correct ones, or set them inside the constructor as passing the values as arguments.
