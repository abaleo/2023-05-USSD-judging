# Removing collateral breaks the collateral order

## Summary
Removing collateral from the collateral array can break the collateral array order, which is important for the protocol since the order of the collateral means the priority by which collateral is sold to force re-peg: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IUSSDRebalancer.sol#L10

## Vulnerability Detail
In this protocol, there is a variable in the `USSD` contract called `collateral` which contains an array of the collaterals used. The order of that array is crucial for the protocol since the order of it is also the order the collateral will be spent (as explained in their whitepaper and also noted [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IUSSDRebalancer.sol#L10)). For example, if DAI is first and ETH second in that array; when rebalancing the protocol, the DAI funds will be used first and then the ETH. That way the protocol behaves as in their whitepaper explains.

There is a function in the `USSD` contract called `removeCollateral` which is used to remove a collateral from the array.

But it is implemented wrongly. Let me show you an example. Let's say we have 4 collaterals in this exact order:
1. DAI
2. WETH
3. WBTC
4. WBGL

And the control role calls the `removeCollateral` function to remove WETH from the array. We would expect the collateral array to be now like this:
1. DAI
2. WBTC
3. WBGL

But the function will make it like this:
1. DAI
2. WBGL
3. WBTC

Messing with the collateral order and thus, making the protocol behave in unexpected ways when rebalancing.

This issue is happening because the function is first copying the value from the last array index to the index we are removing and then removing the last index. But this method will keep the array order only if you are removing the last 2 items but not the rest:

## Impact
Medium, since this makes the protocol behave in a different way that expected and since the order of the array is crucial to the right collateral funds use, it is key to have this function working in the right way.

## Recommendation
You could use a function like the following one to remove the item and keeping the order: https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-by-example/blob/master/remove-from-array.sol#L20-L26
