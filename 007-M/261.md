# Collateral tokens will be stuck on the contract and will be unusable after calling `USSD::removeCollateral()`

## Summary

`USSD::removeCollateral()` removes the ability to use a token as collateral to mint USSD.

The problem is that after removing it from the list, the remaining collateral will be stuck on the contract, as there is not way to transfer it out.

## Vulnerability Detail

`USSD::removeCollateral()` does not transfer the collateral tokens when a token is removed from the list:

```solidity
    function removeCollateral(uint256 _index) public onlyControl {
        collateral[_index] = collateral[collateral.length - 1];
        collateral.pop();
    }
```

There is no method or way to withdraw collateral tokens from the `USSD` contract, and it remain stuck, and unusable.

## Impact

Collateral tokens will be stuck on the contract and will be unusable after calling `USSD::removeCollateral()`.
