# Remove Collateral Logic Is Incorrect

## Summary

Remove Collateral Logic Is Incorrect , The resulting array after removal will be incorrect

## Vulnerability Detail

The removal logic is here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L120

I replicated the logic in remix  , here is what I wrote - 

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.0;


contract Angel{

   uint[] public collateral;
   
   function populateArray(uint x) public {
       collateral.push(x);
   }

   function removecollateral(uint index) public {
       collateral[index] = collateral[collateral.length - 1];
       collateral.pop();
   }}
```
1.) Call populate array 5 times with values 1,2,3,4,5

2.) Call removeCollateral with index 2 (where 3 is stored)

3.) Now check what is stored at index 2 , it is 5 instead of 4

## Impact

According to the logic of the protocol , higher the index higher the volatility of the collateral , here we remove 3 , and the next
volatile asset should have been replaced , but instead got replaced with the most volatile (5) , this might break the peg of USSD

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the correct logic to remove the element from the array
