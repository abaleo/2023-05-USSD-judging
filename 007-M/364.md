# removeCollateral() can brick the entire contract

## Summary
[`removeCollateral()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#LL120C1-L123C6) is a function used by the control contract that is designed to remove finished collateral (already reached 0) or for change in tokens that the protocol wants to remove. The main issue with this function is that when called it removes the desired index (as wanted), but it sends the last collateral index to that value. This leads to further complications, because [`BuyUSSDSellCollateral()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L115-L139) tries to sell `collateral[0]`  not knowing it **index 0** is the last collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
Example:

1 We have an array with collateral **1,2,3,4,5**  pop index 0 (number 1)
2 Now they are **5,2,3,4**
3 Now `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` when called will try to sell `collateral[0]`  in this case collateral 5, instead of 2 

As you can see number 5 has gone from last to first place. Now if or **when** `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` is called it will try to sell `collateral[i].token`, not knowing that is trying to sell collateral 5 and not collateral 2. This is unwanted, the function will fail every time or execute on really bad terms, the contract is either no longer able  to operate or loses funds due to the issue.

```jsx
 IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD));
```
The only way to solve this issue is with is with a few calls to  `swapCollateralIndexes()`. By a few calls I mean, not only one, but a couple. This is the new collateral after the removal of index 0 **5,2,3,4** and if we replace index 0 (5) and index 3 (4), it will just become **4,2,3,5**.
## PoC
Here is an example that you can insert in remix and play with it.
```jsx
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity >=0.8.2 <0.9.0;


contract CollateralMess {
    uint[] collateral;

    function fillUp()public{
    collateral = new uint[](5);
    collateral[0] = 1;
    collateral[1] = 2;
    collateral[2] = 3;
    collateral[3] = 4;
    collateral[4] = 5;

    }
    function removeCollateral(uint256 _index) public returns(uint[] memory){
        collateral[_index] = collateral[collateral.length - 1];
        collateral.pop();
        return collateral;
    }
    function getCollateral() public view returns(uint[] memory) {
        return collateral;
    }

}
```
## Impact
Unpredictable outcome.
## Code Snippet
```jsx
    function removeCollateral(uint256 _index) public onlyControl {
        collateral[_index] = collateral[collateral.length - 1];
        collateral.pop();
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The fix I recommend, you only need to insert the item that you don't want to keep and it will remove && sort the array (you can try it in remix).
```jsx
   function removeItem(uint index) public {
        uint[] memory tempCollateral = new uint[](collateral.length);
        uint count;
        for(uint i;i<collateral.length;i++){

            if (i != index ) {   
                tempCollateral[count] = collateral[i];
                count++;
            }

        }
        collateral = tempCollateral;
        collateral.pop();
```
