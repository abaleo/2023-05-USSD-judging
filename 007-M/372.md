# Improper state update when deleting items from a list in removeCollateral()

## Summary

In USSD.sol, in removeCollateral() function the state is updated incorrectly when deleting elements from an array.

## Vulnerability Detail

removeCollateral() deletes an element from collateral[] by replacing it with the last item in the array and reducing the length by one (pop() method). But this method changes the indexes of 2 elements: the one that's being removed and the last one. And the function doesn't update the index of the last one but only the one that was deleted. The item that was the last now has different index and because it can be referenced in another places, it can be pointed to improperly.

## Impact

The collateral with different index can be pointed to instead of the one that is needed.
