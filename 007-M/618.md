# Not checking balance of collateral before removing it.

## Summary
No check involved for balance of collateral before removing it - in the `removeCollateral`, leading to lockage of the collateral in the contract. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `removeCollateral` function from `USSD.sol` allows `STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE` to remove an existing collateral (let's say X) from the collateral List. But the problem is - there is no check for the balance of  collateral  being removed. It causes problem as the function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` which is used to sell the collateral has line it in as:
```solidity 
 uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
```
which calculates the `amountToSellUnits` of collateral . But as the 'X' which has being already removed from `collateral[]` ,it will not be included in it. Leading to the extra 'X' present in the contract to be locked .
## Impact
Lockage of extra collateral present.

## Recommendation

Consider either reverting if there is balance remaining for a particular collateral, or sending the remaining balance to admin.
