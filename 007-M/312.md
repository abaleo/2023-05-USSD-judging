# Removing collateral type makes the protocol insolvent

## Summary

If `USSD.removeCollateral` is called with token that has previously been supplied as collateral, the protocol becomes insolvent. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol is designed in a way so that minted USSD is collateralized across various tokens. When the pool sells USSD during a rebalance, tokens of every collateral type are purchased.

Therefore, after a rebalance such as this, you can be sure that the protocol has a certain amount of each collateral type.

However, the `removeCollateral` function does not account for the existing balances. It simply removes the collateral from the `collateral` array. Any tokens that have been previously supplied as collateral are still in the contract, but no longer able to be used to purchase USSD from the pool if required to maintain the $1 peg.

## Impact

USSD tokens will be in circulation that are no longer backed by the protocol. This means that the protocol is insolvent.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There should be a check that if the token has been used as collateral, it cannot be removed from the `collateral` array.
