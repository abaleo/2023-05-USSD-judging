# Lack of proper access control in `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions

## Summary
The `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions do not have any access control modifiers. This means that anyone can call these functions and manipulate the token supply by minting or burning an arbitrary amount of tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The functions `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` lack proper access control measures, such as modifiers, to restrict their usage. As a result, any external entity can invoke these functions without any authorization or restrictions. This opens up the possibility for malicious actors to manipulate the token supply by minting or burning tokens in arbitrary amounts.
## Impact
Anyone can arbitrarily mint and burn USSD tokens.
## Code Snippet
[USSD.sol#L204-L210](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-L210)
```solidity
function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control mechanisms or modifiers in the `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions. One possible solution is to add a modifier like `onlyBalancer`, which ensures that only the specified rebalancer address can call these functions.
