# Users lose funds when minting USSD

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L172 

## Vulnerability Detail
`USSD.sol` allows users to deposit one of the supported tokens as collateral and in-return receive back USSD stablecoin. Initially 1000 USSD are minted to be deposited into a USSD/DAI pool backed by 1000 DAI. Thus the price of USSD to DAI is 1-to-1. Therefore the price of USSD will be the same as DAI. For the purposes of this report we will assume the price of DAI is $1 and the price of USSD is also by default $1. 

User A deposits 10 wETH as collateral to mint USSD. The `USSD` contract calculates how much the user will get by calling `calculateMint`.



```solidity
/// @dev Return how much STABLECOIN does user receive for AMOUNT of asset
	function calculateMint(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
    	uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)].oracle.getPriceUSD();
    	return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());
	} 
```  


The current price of wETH is `1,814.31 DAI`, since user A is depositing 10 wETH and 1 USSD stablecoin is 1 DAI, we would assume the amount minted to the user is `18,143.1 USSD `. However, the user receives only a fraction of that.

See POC below.

```solidity
address public priceFeedWeth =  0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419 ;

function testGetPriceUSD() external view returns (uint256) {
       //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
       (, int256 price, , , ) = AggregatorV3Interface(priceFeedWeth).latestRoundData();
       // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD
       console.log("RETRIEVED_PRICE:", uint256(price));
       uint256 assetPrice = uint256(price) * 1e10;
       uint256 _amount = 10 * 1e18; //10 weth 
       uint256 StableAmount = (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** 6)) / 10 ** 18;

       console.log("ASSET_PRICE:", assetPrice);
       console.log("STABLES_MINTED_FOR_10ETH:", StableAmount);
     


   }

```

STABLES_MINTED_FOR_10ETH: 18240215700



Cast Amounts from wei to ETH:

RETRIEVED_PRICE: 0.000000182402157000
ASSET_PRICE: 1824.021570000000000000
STABLES_MINTED_FOR_10ETH:  0.000000018240215700

**NOTE:** This is also the same when using DAI as collateral when minting USSD. Simply replace the priceFeed address to DAI/USD address eg: [0xaed0c38402a5d19df6e4c03f4e2dced6e29c1ee9](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/dai-usd)

## Impact
Users lose funds when minting USSD with collateral.
