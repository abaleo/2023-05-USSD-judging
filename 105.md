# Possible to mint/burn arbitrary amount of USSD by transferring DAI/USSD to UniV3 pool directly

## Summary
There is an issue in the rebalance() function, which makes decisions based on the current token price and the token supply proportions.

The token supply calculation doesn't align with the current token price, because it may include tokens that are not within the current trading range (out of range liquidity) or it's also possible to transfer DAI to the UniV3 pool without providing liquidity which will make value provided by getSupplyProportion() inconsistent with getOwnValuation().

Let's break down the functions:

- getOwnValuation(): Retrieves the current price of the tokens using the Uniswap pool address. It calculates the price depending on which token is first in the pool.
- getSupplyProportion(): Returns the balance of tokens in the Uniswap pool. This function considers all tokens, even those outside the current trading range.
- rebalance(): Uses the previous two functions to determine if a rebalance is needed. If the current value is less than the threshold, it buys USSD and sells collateral. If it's more than the threshold, it mints USSD and buys collateral.

The problem arises in rebalance(). Since the supply proportion can include out-of-range liquidity, and also DAI sent to pool without providing liquidity to pool this scenario could lead to miscalculations when minting new tokens. Essentially, the contract is using the current tick price from getOwnValuation(), which doesn't reflect the entire pool's liquidity situation, leading to a potential over or under minting of tokens during the rebalance operation.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose you have a USSD-DAI Uniswap V3 Pool. Assume the current price of USSD in terms of DAI is 1.1, that is, 1 USSD = 1.1 DAI. This is retrieved from the getOwnValuation() function.

Let's say there are 1,000 USSD tokens and 1100 DAI tokens in the current tick. 50 * 99 / 100 USSD _(using error margin defined in the contract)_ needs to be minted and sold  in order to restore the peg. Now, let's consider the supply of both tokens in the pool in below scenarios. 
- Scenario 1:  A malicious actor can send 400 DAI to the pool by directly transferring it to liquidity pool and when rebalance() function evaluates getSupplyProportion() the values will be 1000 USSD and 1500 DAI causing contract to mint 250 * 99 / 100 _(using error margin defined in the contract)_ instead of expected 50 * 99 / 100 USSD _(using error margin defined in the contract)_
  - When contract tries to sell these 250 tokens to pool, the token will depeg in other direction.

The same scenario can happen while burning USSD.
  
## Impact

**High**
It can lead to minting/burning of incorrect amount of USSD.

```solidity
// ISSUE: Direct contract balances are queried from ERC20 contract which can potentially have no relation with estimated price
(uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
```

```solidity
// ISSUE: no check performed before and after swapping from the pool, entire minted amount is swapped in pool
IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculate liquidity for the active range in UniV3 instead of relying on UniV3 pool's ERC20 balance
