# Reliance on TWAP price is not safe due to possiblity Multi-block MEV

## Summary
After merge, it is cheaper to manipulate TWAPs, because you already know the next block proposer.
And since the USSD protocol uses TWAPs at multiple places to evaluate collateral, it exposes protocol to attacks involving Multi-block TWAP manipulation.

## Vulnerability Detail
USSD protocol uses TWAP for multiple collaterals (DAI, WBGL) to evaluate their value.

The promise of TWAP is its spot manipulation proof since the price calculation is spread over multiple blocks.
However, this doesn't remain true after MERGE, since now it's possible for an attacker to execute a Multi-Block MEV due to knowledge of the next proposer in advance.

Consider going through this blog post for more details.

## Impact
Attackers can over or under value the collateral.
Can mint more USSD than intended for given collateral, or can mint/burn more or fewer tokens than intended inside rebalance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a secondary oracle to price feeds to verify the deviation between twap and actual market price
