# Incorrect Calculation return in StableOracleDAI#getPriceUSD Function

## Summary

The StableOracleDAI#getPriceUSD function is incorrectly computing the DAI/USD price due to improper handling of exchange rates and decimal precision. A detailed given below.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the StableOracleDAI#getPriceUSD function, three prices are used: wethPriceUSD, DAIWethPrice, and priceFeedDAIETH price to calculate the DAI/USD rate. However, there are two issues in the computation of the DAI/USD price:

1. while taking average we need to consider that DAIWethPriceis giving $\frac{WETH}{DAI}$ rate but chainlink priceFeedDAIETH price giving $\frac{DAI}{WETH}$  rate so while calculating average we calculate wrong rate.

```solidity
        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```

2. The priceFeedDAIETH returns an 18-decimal rate, not an 8-decimal rate. This can be verified on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4#readContract#F3). Thus, when calculating the average, it's incorrect to multiply the price by $10^{10}$.

```solidity
        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD, so multiply by 10 decimals to get 18 decimal fractional

        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```


## Impact

The incorrect DAI price calculation can result in a wrong price return from getPriceUSD function.
