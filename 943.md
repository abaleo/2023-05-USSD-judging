# Oracle manipulation is possible if the pool’s liquidity is low and TVL of USSD is high

## Summary
In the situation of pool’s liquidity is low and TVL of USSD protocol is high, it can open up certain opportunities for the attacker to gain profit by manipulating the price of Unsiwap V3 oracle. 

## Vulnerability Detail
I noticed in the protocol there is a wBGL token, whose liquidity on Ethereum is not that high. As of now, [the liquidity is only 11k dollar](https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0x2bA64EFB7A4Ec8983E22A49c81fa216AC33f383A) on Ethereum mainnet.

And the minting process of USSD is based on this pool's oracle as shown in the code snippet. 

Even Uniswap oracle is TWAP price based, this exposes extreme risk to the protocol, any attacker with enough funds in the market can easily move the USSD token price as they want. Or the best case for the attacker is they hold large amount of wBGL and pump the price on Uniwap V3 to make sure nobody can sell wBGL to let the price go down. 

In this case the attacking process is: 
1. The attacker buys all of the USSD token in the Uniswap v3 wBGL/wETH pool which the protocol is referring to as oracle price of wBGL. 
2. The attacker mint USSD token through calling `mintForToken` function by using the manipulated wBGL's oracle. 
3. The attacker can sell the USSD token in the DAI/USSD pool to gain profits. 
4. Because the liquidity of DAI/USSD is better than that of wBGL token, so the profit will be generated and the attacker can steal the profits from the protocol. 



## Impact
The protocol can suffer from the loss of funds. 
An attacker can manipulate the price of  wBGL's low liquidity pool of Uniswap v3 to play with the protocol's minting process to steal funds from the protocol. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
File: USSD.sol
152:     function mintForToken(
153:         address token,
154:         uint256 tokenAmount,
155:         address to
156:     ) public returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
157:         require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token"); // @audit-info make sure it has certain token as collateral to mint
158: 
159:         IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
160:             msg.sender,
161:             address(this),
162:             tokenAmount
163:         );
164:         stableCoinAmount = calculateMint(token, tokenAmount);
165:         _mint(to, stableCoinAmount);
166: 
167:         emit Mint(msg.sender, to, token, tokenAmount, stableCoinAmount);
168:     }
169: 
170:     /// @dev Return how much STABLECOIN does user receive for AMOUNT of asset
171:     function calculateMint(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
172:         uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)].oracle.getPriceUSD(); // @audit this is a risk when liquidity is low
173:         return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals()); 174:     }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Avoid using small market cap coins with less liquidity as collateral, because usually there is no enough liquidity in the Dex for the token and the oracle will not work for supporting a healthy stable coin system. 
If you can find a coin with a Chainlink price feed it would be much better like wBTC and wETH, which is already being used in the protocol's oracle. 

Finally, I also advise you to use a double-oracle system as what I have mentioned in my other report. 

Thanks!
