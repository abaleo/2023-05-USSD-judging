# Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` can return stale or incorrect result

## Summary

The function `getPriceUSD` inside the oracle contracts : `StableOracleWETH`, `StableOracleWBTC` and `StableOracleDAI` does make a call to the Chainlink `latestRoundData()` function but doesn't contain checks on the returned price (if its equal to zero or not), round completeness and update timestamp, which could lead to returning a stale or wrong price and thus the protocol functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected and sometimes can lead to a loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue occurs in the instances below :

When getting WETH/USD in StableOracleDAI.sol#L48

```solidity
(, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```

When getting WBTC/USD in StableOracleWBTC.sol#23

```solidity
(, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```

When getting WETH/USD in StableOracleWETH.sol#L23

```solidity
(, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```

In each of the instances above the function `getPriceUSD` calls the function `latestRoundData()` to get the USD price of a certain token (WETH, WBTC) using chainlink price feeds, but the function `getPriceUSD` does not contain the required checks for verifying that the returned price from the `latestRoundData()` call is not equal to zero and to also check the round timestamp and completeness to avoid outdated results, this can lead to stale prices according to Chainlink's documentation.

As the USSD protocol uses the oracles to evaluate the collateral value of a given token, it must receive accurate price feed and in the case when an oracle return a stale/wrong price this will have a negative impact on the USSD token and can lead to a deppeg and a potential to a loss of funds.

## Recommendation

Add the required checks whenever the latestRoundData() function is called in the aforementioned instances.
