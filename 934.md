# Uniswap pool fee is hardcoded which can lead to price manipulation problems

## Summary
The USSDRebalancer is using Uniswap to rebalance the USSD, they uniswap pool are organized in different tiers, thee contract is hardcoded to use the 0,05% tier, this can lead to price manipulation or dos. 
## Vulnerability Detail
As the USSDRebalancer is using uniswap pool to swap DAI for USSD or USSD for DAI, all the paths for a uniswap pool needs to have a fee attach to it, because they are organized in fee tier (0,01%, 0,05%, 0,3%, 1%), the stablecoisn are usually traded in the 0,01% pool, if someone will create the 0,01% liquidity pool in uniswap and all the liquidity will migrate to it, the USSD ecosystem will have problems because the 0,05% fee is hardcoded in the USSDRebalancer, this can lead to either price manipulation or dos.
## Impact
Price manipulation or dos thanks to the low liquidity as  the ecosystem is bounded to use the 0,05% fee tier.

## Recommendation
1. Make the fee tier to be setteble by contract owner 
2. Query all the available pools to always use the pool with highest liqudity.
