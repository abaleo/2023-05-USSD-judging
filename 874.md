# Chainlink lastestRoundData is not checked for stale or round completeness

## Summary
It currently has no checks at all
## Vulnerability Detail
latestRoundData returns: (uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound). 
In order to ensure Chainlink returned the correct price, these needs to be checked. 
## Impact
Not checking returned values can result in wrong price calculations of `getPriceUSD`.
