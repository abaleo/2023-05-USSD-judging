# Limited Routing Options in Protocol is a Downside


## Summary

Though this is a problem of the whole protocol, let's just use the USSD contract as an explanation case, the USSD contract is designed to be an autonomous on-chain stablecoin, but it suffers from a limitation in its routing options. The contract restricts all swap operations to a single Uniswap router, which hinders the decentralization efforts of the protocol. Additionally, this limitation poses a risk as the selected Uniswap router may not provide optimal liquidity for a specific token at a specific time compared to another router. Utilizing a different aggregator like Paraswap or allowing multiple routers could potentially offer better liquidity and improve the routing efficiency.

## Vulnerability Detail

The USSD contract enforces the use of a single Uniswap router for all swap operations:

Take the below just for example

```solidity
function UniV3SwapInput(
    bytes memory _path,
    uint256 _sellAmount
) public override onlyBalancer {
    IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
        .ExactInputParams({
            path: _path,
            recipient: address(this),
            //deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: _sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: 0
        });
    uniRouter.exactInput(params);
}
```

As a result, all swaps are performed exclusively through the specified Uniswap router.

## Impact

The limited routing options in the USSD contract can have the following impact:

1. Centralization Risk: By enforcing the use of a single Uniswap router, the contract deviates from the protocol's objective of decentralization. Restricting swap operations to a single router contradicts the principles of decentralized finance (DeFi).

2. Limited Liquidity Access: The selected Uniswap router may not have optimal liquidity for all tokens. This limitation poses a risk to users as they may encounter challenges in finding sufficient liquidity sources for certain tokens, potentially resulting in suboptimal swap rates and increased slippage.

## Tool used

This bug report is based on a manual review of the provided contract code.

## Recommendation

To address the limited routing options and promote decentralization, it is recommended to enhance the USSD contract's functionality by considering the following recommendations:

1. Multiple Routers: Allow users to select from multiple routers for swap operations. By incorporating support for different routers, such as Uniswap V2, Sushiswap, and other decentralized exchanges, users gain access to a wider range of liquidity sources, improving efficiency and reducing slippage.

2. Aggregator Integration: Consider integrating aggregator protocols like Paraswap to enhance the routing capabilities. Aggregators can leverage multiple liquidity sources and routing strategies to provide users with improved swap rates and reduced slippage.

3. Dynamic Routing Logic: Implement dynamic routing logic that intelligently selects the most optimal router or aggregator based on factors such as liquidity availability, token pair popularity, and historical trade data. This ensures efficient and cost-effective token swaps for users.

By implementing these recommendations, the USSD contract can provide users with more options and better liquidity access, aligning with the protocol's goal of decentralization and improving the overall user experience.
