# uniswap trades are done without slippage

## Summary
Trades with the uniswap pools are done without slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail
Trades with the uniswap pools are done without slippage. Not providing any slippage will cause the trades to be at the mercy of MEV bots and sandwich trading, stealing value from users.

## Impact
MEV and sandwich trades will make the traded amounts a lot less than wanted at the expense of the protocol.
