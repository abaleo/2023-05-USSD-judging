# Spot price of USSD/DAI pool can be manipulated

## Summary

Spot price of USSD/DAI pool can be manipulated.

## Vulnerability Detail

`USSDRebalancer:getOwnValuation` uses `uniPool.slot0()` to determine the current price of USSD/DAI. `slot0` represent the spot price in the Uniswap pool, that can be manipulated very easily, especially in pools with low liquidity.

`getOwnValuation` is called by `rebalance` in order to determine whether USSD has lost its peg and the protocol needs to swap USSD for collateral to recover the peg.

## Impact

An attacker can easily manipulate the spot price in the USSD/DAI pool and cause the `rebalance` function not to work as expected, loosing the ability to serve as a tool for recovering the peg.

## Recommendation

Use TWAP instead of `slot0` .
