# `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` may revert due to underflow when DAI depeg

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

When DAI loses its peg, for example, if 1100 DAI is only worth 1000 USD, then 1000 USD worth of WETH could be sold for 1100 DAI.

However, if `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` is triggered during such circumstances, the transaction would revert due to underflow at L123 and/or L136.

## Recommendation

When the amount bought is higher than `amountToBuyLeftUSD`, it should be set to 0.
