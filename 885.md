# By monitoring the CollateralList edit, the BuyUSSDSellCollateral function can be disabled and the USSD token can be burned.

## Summary
CollateralList can be edited by the administrator, and the contents of the list may be temporarily empty during editing.
When that situation occurs, the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function is called by invoking the `rebalance` function.
However, if `CollateralList` is empty, most of the process is skipped and `IUSSD(USSD).burnRebalancer(IUSSD(USSD).balanceOf(USSD))` is executed.
This will burn all USSD tokens held by the USSD address without buying USSD or selling Collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
Collateral can be removed by `USSD.removeCollateral`.
Then, there is a possibility that Collateral may temporarily become zero at the time of reorganization.
At that timing, invoking `USSDRebalancer.rebalance()` will execute `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()`.
This function does most of the processing in `for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++)`.
However, if the contents of the `collateralLis`t is empty, this process is skipped.
Then the last line `IUSSD(USSD).burnRebalancer(IUSSD(USSD).balanceOf(USSD))` is executed to burn the token.
No USSD is bought or Collateral is sold, and the token is burned.
## Impact
The balance of USSD tokens held by a USSD address is used in the calculation within `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`, which would upset this calculation.
Also, it is unnatural behavior that only the burn process is executed without any execution of what is written in the function name (`BuyUSSDSellCollateral`).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Disallow collateral to be set to zero or prevent function execution if zero
