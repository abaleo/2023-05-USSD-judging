# Wrong address is given to the oracle to get the price of WBTC

## Summary
`StableOracleWBTC.sol` seems to be the exact copy of `StableOracleWETH.sol`. And at the end the dev must have forgotten to change the address of ETH/USD price feed and WBTC is returning the price of ETH instead of WBTC.


## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
in StableOracleWBTC.sol:

    constructor() {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            //@audit wrong address (Eth/usd)
            0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419
        );
    }
```

```solidity
in StableOracleWETH.sol:

    constructor() {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            //@audit correct address
            0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419
        );
    }
```

## Impact
Users will be able to provide WBTC as collateral and get a huge amount of USSD at the price of ETH.
