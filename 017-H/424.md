# Wrong oracle data passed blocks the system

## Summary
High Severity

## Vulnerability Detail

In `StableOracleDAI.sol` and `StableOracleWBGL.sol` the contract addresses passed within the `constructor()` are wrong as follows: 

In `StableOracleDAI.sol`: 

The hardcoded address initiated as `IStaticOracle` and stored in `DAIEthOracle` variable points to the WETH/WBGL pool on UniswapV3.

```solidity
        DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e
        );
```

The address initiated as `IStaticOracle` and stored in the `ethOracle` variable is the `0x0` address.

```solidity
 ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000);
```

In `StableOracleWBGL.sol`:

The address initiated as `IStaticOracle` and stored in the `staticOracleUniV3` is the address of the WETH/WBGL UniswapV3 pool.

```solidity
 staticOracleUniV3 = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e
        );
```

## Impact

As the UniswapV3 Pool contract does not have a `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` function all calls made in the `getPriceUSD()` in both `StableOracleDAI.sol` and `StableOracleWBGL.sol` to `DAIEthOracle` and `staticOracleUniV3` respectively will revert blocking the `rebalance()` and `mintForTokens()` functionalities which are core functionalities of the protocol.

Any calls to the `ethOracle` in the `StableOracleDAI.sol` would also fail as they will be sent to the `0x0` address again impacting both the `rebalance()` and `mintForTokens()` functionalities.

## Tool used

Manual Review / Foundry

## Recommendation

The best approach would to be to instead hardcode addresses, pass them as constructor parameters. This would both help avoid the above mentioned issue and allow for deployment on other chains without having to change the contract logic.

For `StableOracleDAI.sol`:

Refactor the constructor as follows, where `_ethOracle` points to a deployed instance of `StableOracleWETH.sol` which retrieves the ETH/USD price from Chainlink and `_uniStaticOracle` points to a deployed version of the `UniswapV3StaticOracle.sol`.

*Note: I would also suggest to pass the Chainlink aggregator address as constructor parameter as well.

```solidity
constructor(address _ethOracle, address _uniStaticOracle) {
        priceFeedDAIETH = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4
        );
        DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(_uniStaticOracle);
        ethOracle = IStableOracle(_ethOracle); // TODO: WETH oracle price
    }
```

For `StableOracleWBGL.sol`:

Refactor the constructor as follows, where `_uniStaticOracle` points to a deployed version of `UniswapV3StaticOracle.sol`.

```solidity
constructor(address _WETHoracle, address _uniStaticOracle) {
        staticOracleUniV3 = IStaticOracle(
            _uniStaticOracle
        );
        ethOracle = IStableOracle(_WETHoracle);
    }
```
