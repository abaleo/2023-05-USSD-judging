# StableOracleWBTC uses BTC/USD chainlink oracle to price WBTC which is problematic if WBTC depegs.

## Summary
The chainlink BTC/USD oracle is used to price WBTC. WBTC is basically a bridged asset and if the bridge is compromised/fails then WBTC will depeg and will no longer be equivalent to BTC. This will lead to large amounts of minting of USSD using WBTC which is now effectively worthless. Although the admin has the ability to remove collateral, a large amount of minting could be done before `removeCollateral` is called.
## Vulnerability Detail
See summary. 
## Impact
Protocol could allow for a large amount of USSD minting should WBTC bridge become compromised and WBTC depegs.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would recommend setting up a double oracle similar to the `StableOracleWBGL`.
