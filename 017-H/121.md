# `StableOracleWBTC::getPriceUSD()` is using ETH/USD as its price feed

## Summary

`StableOracleWBTC::getPriceUSD()` is using ETH/USD as its price feed instead of some WBTC one. This will return incorrect prices to the `USSD::mintForToken()` function.

This will ultimately lead into minting an incorrect amount of USSD tokens to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

`StableOracleWBTC` uses `0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419` as its price feed, but that corresponds to the ETH/USD pair as can be seen in [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419):

```solidity
    constructor() {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419 // @audit
        );
    }
```

This will return a completely incorrect price that will be used as a reference to mint USSD tokens via the `UUSD::mintForToken()` function.

## Impact

`USSD::mintForToken()` will mint an incorrect amount of USSD tokens when using the WBTC oracle.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a `getPriceUSD` function similar to the one from `StableOracleWBGL`, to calculates the WBTC/USD the price using auxiliary price feeds.

This is because there is no WBTC/USD Chainlink feed at the moment as can be checked on their [documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/).

It has to be noted that there is a BTC/USD feed, but **it should not be used**. The `StableOracleWBTC` code even suggests the intent of using it:

```solidity
10:    chainlink btc/usd priceFeed 0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c; // @audit
```

It shouldn't be used because BTC/USD does not hold the same price as WBTC/USD. It is a wrapped version from a different blockchain and it has also shown depeg in the past.

It is not the same case as WETH, which is "native" to Ethereum and can be converted to and from ETH for the same amount.
