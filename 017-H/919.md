# The dai oralce gets the price of WBGL pool

## Summary
The `DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(  0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e  );`
which is the wbgl pool and there is no dai in the price feed.
## Vulnerability Detail
Since the oracle is getting the price and not calculating dai but instead making the function get the wrong price and possibly revert with the different token0 and token1.
## Impact
Reverting, for the main Oracle, redeployment, and if it does allow it to be called it will get the wrong price for the pool.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e
        );
