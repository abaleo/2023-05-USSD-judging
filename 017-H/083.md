# quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod() will not work because dependency is not integrated

## Summary

quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod() uses Mean-Finance integration which is not installed in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

StaticOracle is a tool developed by Mean Finance under Uniswap's grant program that aims to help developers integrate easily and fast with Uniswap's v3 TWAP oracles. StaticOracle will allow developers to:
- Prepare a set of pools (for example: by a token pair and a fee tier) to support a certain period of time (for example: 60 seconds).
- Quote a TWAP for a set of pools (for example: by a token pair and a fee tier, or addresses).

The package is missing from the dependency folder. Integrating the StaticOracle should look something like this in package.json:

```javascript
  "dependencies": {
    "@mean-finance/uniswap-v3-oracle": "^1.0.3",
    "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.7.3",
```

## Impact

quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod() will not work.
