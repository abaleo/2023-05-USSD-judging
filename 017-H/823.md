# StableOracleWBTC using BTC/USD chainlink oracle to price WBTC which have a potential problematic issue if WBTC depegs

## Summary

StableOracleWBTC using BTC/USD chainlink oracle to price WBTC which have a potential problematic issue if WBTC depegs

## Vulnerability Detail

The chainlink BTC/USD oracle is used to price WBTC. WBTC serves as a bridged asset that enables the representation of Bitcoin on other blockchain networks, in this case Ethereum. However, if the bridge supporting WBTC encounters any compromise or failure, it will result in the detachment of WBTC from its peg to BTC, rendering it no longer equivalent to Bitcoin. This disconnection poses a significant risk as it can trigger a situation where a considerable amount of borrowing takes place against an asset that essentially holds no value.

```solidity
File: StableOracleWBTC.sol
12: contract StableOracleWBTC is IStableOracle {
13:     AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed;
14: 
15:     constructor() {
16:         priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
17:             0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419
18:         );
19:     }
20: 
21:     function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
22:         //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
23:         (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
24:         // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD
25:         return uint256(price) * 1e10;
26:     }
27: }
```

This issue is considered a valid medium in other audit contest from top auditor, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/9, and the USSD is also fall on this category.

## Impact

Failure to fetch actual BTC price on chainlink, resulting multiple issues on minting, and rebalance the USSD because in one aspect it's related with the price of BTC.

## Tool used

Manual Review and Referencing a valid medium issue from previous audit https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/9

## Recommendation

Consider to use double oracle setup, Chainlink and another on-chain liquidity base oracle (i.e. UniV3 TWAP) like the one with WBGL & DAI
