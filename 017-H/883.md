# Weth and Wbtc oracles  will return the same price,causing users funds to be lost

## Summary
Wbtc oracle returns WETH price
## Vulnerability Detail
Weth and wbtc oracles return the same price 
since when we get the `latestRoundData` the price of wbtc is gathered from `0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419` which is eth/usd oracle and in the comments, there is the right priceFeed but it is not put there.
Since this is a great error it means wbtc is 90 percent undervalued causing less to be minted and the collateral factor will be off and it will cause a loss of funds for the receiver of the mintForTokens function.
## Impact
Dosnt gets as many tokens as it gave to the contract
ex: Alice gives 1 wbtc but since the price 1850 per eth, the Wbtc oracle which gets the wrong price, will only give $1850 to Alice instead of $25,000 per btc.
Since this is Oracle specified in the codeBase it is important then even if the Oracle can be switched, the wrong price is returned.
