# Pricing WBTC with BTC/USD feed

## Summary
Protocol price WBTC price using chainlink BTC/USD feed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Using BTC/USD feed as a proxy for WBTC pricing is incorrect logic, and in case of WBTC depeg the WBTC/USD will diverge from BTC/USD price.

## Impact
High, in event of depeg users will be able to mint more USSD based on their collateral due to wrong wbtc pricing.
