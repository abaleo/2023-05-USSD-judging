# Incorrect ``staticOracleUniV3`` configuration for ``StableOracleWBGL`` would revert all protocol actions

## Summary
Due to the wrong configuration of staticOracleUniV3 for StableOracleWBGL, all actions involving `StableOracleWBGL. getPriceUSD()` would revert, thereby reverting all user actions (mint, rebalance) as explained below.

## Vulnerability Detail
USSD defines `StableOracleWBGL` to fetch the price for WBGL in terms of USD.
A TWAP price for WETH/WBGL is fetched using  `staticOracleUniV3` and then using the price of WETH from chainlink, it's converted into USD.
However, instead of configuring a static oracle address for `staticOracleUniV3`, USSD has a pool address of WBGL/WETH configured, **and there is no way to change this later.**

Since uniswap pool contract doesn't have a method for `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` defined, it would revert here

## Impact
This would impact all protocol actions
**Minting USSD (for any token)**

**Rebalance :** 
`SellUSSDBuyCollateral` in :red_circle:  all cases :red_circle: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L190
`BuyUSSDSellCollateral` in cases where you need to sell WBGL, 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L116

Once misconfigured, this can not be mitigated on oracle level, since there is no way to change staticOracleUniV3 after deployment.

## Recommendation
Consider configuring the correct `staticOracleUniV3` address, either you can use the already deployed contract from Mean Finance, or deploy your own.
