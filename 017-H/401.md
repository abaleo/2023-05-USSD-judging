# Incorrect address used as IStaticOracle

## Summary
StableOracleDAI.sol and StableOracleWBGL.sol use `0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e` as `IStaticOracle`, but this address is that of the Uniswap V3 WETH<>WBGL pool, which doesn't implement such interface.

## Vulnerability Detail
The two oracles rely on an instance of `IStaticOracle` in order to correctly calculate their specific token's price w.r.t. USD, but they incorrectly use the address of a Uniswap V3 pool as a `IStaticOracle`.
Given that UniV3 pools don't implement such interface and don't implement `fallback()` nor `receive()`, calling `getPriceUSD()` on these oracles will revert the transaction.

## Impact
Oracle is unusable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the correct address for the Uniswap V3 StaticOracle, provided [here](https://github.com/Mean-Finance/uniswap-v3-oracle/blob/main/deployments/ethereum/StaticOracle.json#L2) by the mean-finance team in their github repository.
