# Misconfigured price feed for BTC/USD instead of ETH/USD

## Summary
The priceFeed variable in the `StableOracleWBTC` contract is currently set to an address representing the ETH/USD Price Feed instead of the BTC/USD Price Feed. This mismatch can lead to inaccurate price calculations and decisions related to BTC.
## Vulnerability Detail
The priceFeed variable in the constructor is set to AggregatorV3Interface with the address 0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419, which corresponds to the Price Feed for ETH/USD. However, it is mentioned that the intended Price Feed should be for BTC/USD, which has the address 0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c.

```solidity
    constructor() {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419
        );
    }

```
## Impact
This misconfiguration of the Price Feed can lead to incorrect price calculations and potential inaccuracies in determining the BTC/USD price within the smart contract.

## Recommendation
