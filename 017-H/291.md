# StableOracleWBTC uses Chainlink ETH/USD price feed instead of BTC/USD price feed

## Summary

The USSD protocol uses several Chainlink price feeds to the get up-to-date price of tokens.

For the `StableOracleWBTC` which should return the USD price of BTC to get the value of the wBTC token which is used as collateral, the wrong Chainlink price feed is used (ETH/USD instead of BTC/USD).

Since the prices of ETH and BTC are vastly different (BTC is currently 14x the price of ETH) calculations in the USSD protocol based on the StableOracleWBTC are off by a large margin.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `StableOracleWBTC` the wrong contract address is passed to the `AggregatorV3Interface` (https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L17).

Instead of using the correct address `0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c` as commented correctly in https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L10 it uses `0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419`. This is the address of the Chainlink ETH/USD price feed.

In consequence, the `getPriceUSD()`function exposes the fetched result of the wrongly implemented `StableOracleWBTC` which has an effect on the following aspects of the USSD protocol:

### 1. How much tokens are minted for a user providing wBTC as collateral
The `mintForToken` function of `USSD.sol` calls the `calculateMint` function https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L163 which calculates the tokens that will be minted for a given amount of collateral a user provides. It relies on the correct USD value being available for the collateral to be correct.

Currently looking at the test available in the project, wBTC may not be used as collateral (mint parameter = false; https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/test/USSDsimulator.test.js#L200). But this could be changed via the `addCollateral` function in `USSD.sol` and hence there is a chance that minting is affected.

### 2. Rebalancing (SellUSSDBuyCollateral)
The `collateralFactor` function in `USSD.sol` compares the total value of the protocols collateral with the total supply of the USSD token to determine the collateral factor. https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L193. Since the price of ETH is used to value the wBTC collateral the collateral factor, given the price difference of both assets, the collateral factor is off by a large amount.

This influences `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function for the rebalancing, where the `collateralFactor` determines which "flutter" is chosen and in consequence how many USSD tokens are sold and how much of which collateral is bought: https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L178.

### 3. Rebalancing (BuyUSSDSellCollateral)
The `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function uses the `getPriceUSD`function to determine the collateral value in multiple places which controls how much USSD is bought and collateral is sold:
- Calculation of the collateral value: https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L116
- https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L190
- https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L197

## Impact

As described in the vulnerability details, the correctness of collateral asset prices has a huge impact on the protocol as it breaks key assumptions of the project.

## Recommendation

Use the correct address for the Chainlink BTC/USD price feed in `StableOracleWBTC`:

```solidity
constructor() {
    priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
        0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c
    );
}
```
