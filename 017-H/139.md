# Misconfigured Oracle Address in StableOracleDAI.sol

## Summary

The StableOracleDAI contract is incorrectly configured to use the WBGLETH Oracle when it appears that the intention was to use the DAIETH Oracle, as suggested by the contract's name and comments.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the StableOracleDAI contract, the address for DAIEthOracle is configured to point to the WBGL/ETH UniswapV3 pool (https://etherscan.io/address/0x982152a6c7f732ec7c9ea998ddd9ebde00dfa16e : 0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e) instead of the DAI/ETH. This means that the oracle data used within this contract for price calculations and, potentially, other functionality is based on the WBGL/ETH pair rather than the expected DAI/ETH pair.

## Impact

Using an incorrect pool or oracle could lead to miscalculations in the contract's operation. It could result in inaccurate price information or could even be exploited by an attacker if they can manipulate data. This issue might also reduce trust in the system and its ability to provide accurate and reliable data.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L28

```solidity
    constructor() {
        ...
        DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e //E wbgl/weth uni v3 @audit-issue 
        );
        ...
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, the constructor should be changed to instantiate DAI/EthOracle with the correct address.
```solidity
constructor() {
    ...
    DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(0x60594a405d53811d3bc4766596efd80fd545a270);
    ...
}

```
