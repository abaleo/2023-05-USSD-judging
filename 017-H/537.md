# Protocol calculations breaking due to wrong Uniswap pool hardcoded address

## Summary
The protocol uses different oracles to calculate the current collateral rations, buying proportions... Basically every important function in the protocol relies on correct oracle values. In this issue, one pool used as an oracle for the price of DAI/ETH is hardcoded with the wrong one (WBGL/WETH) returning always a wrong price and because of that the protocol rebalancing system will be broken and useless.

## Vulnerability Detail
The DAI Oracle (`StableOracleDAI.sol`) has in the constructor the addresses of the oracles used internally hardcoded. One of them is used for a UniswapV3StaticOracle between DAI and ETH. So, to work in the expected way, it should use the address of the DAI/ETH pool, which is commented a few lines up in the contract:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L15

But instead, it is using another address (which happens to be the one for the WBGL/ETH pool):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L28

So this will affect heavily the price (especially since the price difference between those two assets, DAI and WBGL is big) calculated by this contract (and used for rebalancing the protocol). Then the protocol, when rebalancing, will trade the wrong amounts of funds due to the incorrect price, potentially breaking the protocol.

## Impact

Having the wrong price feed in the oracle will make all the calculations using the price of DAI to be wrong breaking the basic logic of the protocol, spending incorrect amounts of collateral funds when rebalancing and potentially breaking the protocol and making it unable to keep the peg of the stablecoin.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the incorrect pool address in the constructor of `StableOracleDAI.sol` with the correct one:
```solidity
constructor() {
        // Rest of the code....
        DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(
            0x60594a405d53811d3bc4766596efd80fd545a270
        );
        // Rest of the code....
    }
```
