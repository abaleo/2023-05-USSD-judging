# Using `UniswapV3Pool` contract addresses for `StaticOracle` fields

## Summary

In multiple places inside of the oracle contracts, we are assigning hard-coded addresses of deployed `UniswapV3Pool` contracts to `IStaticOracle` fields.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since the `UniswapV3Pool` contracts do not implement the `IStaticOracle` interface, this means that each function call on those fields will fail.

## Impact

Each function that calls functions on those fields will always revert. More specifically, those are the `getPriceUSD` functions on the `StableOracleWBGL` and `StableOracleDAI` oracle contracts, which will make both of them permanently unusable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the address of the already deployed by Mean Finance `StaticOracle` contract:  https://etherscan.io/address/0xB210CE856631EeEB767eFa666EC7C1C57738d438. 

Another option would be to deploy your own instance of the contract and use its address instead, if the above-mentioned one does not suffice your needs.
