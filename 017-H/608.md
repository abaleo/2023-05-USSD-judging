# Incorrect Configuration of DAIEthOracle in StableOracleDAI and StableOracleWBGL Contract

## Summary
`StableOracleDAI.sol` and `StableOracleWBGL.sol` contains a vulnerability due to the incorrect configuration of the `DAIEthOracle` address. As a result, the contract is unable to fetch the DAI/WETH price, impacting various functionalities within the `USSD.sol` contract. The DAI/WETH price is used in calculations such as `calculateMint` and collateral factor determination, as well as being a critical component in the rebalancing process of the USSD contract. Due to the incorrect configuration, the contract fails to retrieve the required price information, leading to reverts and rendering the contract unusable for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect configuration of the `DAIEthOracle` address in the `StableOracleDAI` contract. The contract expects the `DAIEthOracle` to be set as a `StaticOracle`, but it is instead configured as a `UniswapV3 pool` (specifically, WBGL pool). Consequently, when attempting to invoke `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod`, the function call fails, leading to subsequent reverts when `getPriceUSD` is called. These reverts prevent users from utilizing the contract effectively, as the required price data cannot be fetched.

## Impact
The incorrect configuration of the `DAIEthOracle` in `StableOracleDAI` prevents the retrieval of the DAI/WETH price, adversely affecting various functionalities within the USSD.sol contract. This vulnerability impacts the accuracy of calculations, such as mint calculation and collateral factor determination, which rely on the DAI/WETH price. Additionally, the rebalancing process within the USSD contract, a critical component of the contract's core logic, relies on this price information. The inability to fetch the required price data due to reverts renders the contract unusable for users, hindering its intended functionality.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is crucial to ensure that the `DAIEthOracle` address in the `StableOracleDAI` contract is correctly configured as a `StaticOracle`. The `DAIEthOracle` should be set to a valid `StaticOracle` contract that provides accurate DAI/WETH price information.
