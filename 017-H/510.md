# ethOracle price feed is hard-coded to zero address

## Summary
In the StableOracleDAI.sol#L30, Zero address instead of correct ethOracle price feed address.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    constructor() {
        priceFeedDAIETH = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4
        );
        DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e
        );
        ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000); // TODO: WETH oracle price
    }
```
As you can see, ethOracle is hard-coded to a zero address instead of the correct WETH Oracle price feed address. the protocol is using ethOracle to get the fresh price of WETH Price in USD but call to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 address will get a revert.

## Impact
Call to the StableOracleDAI.sol#L33.getPriceUSD() to get price of DAI will not work.

Considering that the process of [re-balancing ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L92)and pegging and de-pegging the USSD is dependent on the price and value of the collateral asset and the BUY and SELL of USSD or collateral asset is done based on the price of the collateral asset, The wrong price for the collateral asset will cause the re-balancing process to not be done well or to go wrong at all, and this will cause the USSD to be de-pegged and the users' funds to be lost.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use correct address of ethOracle price feed.
