# StableOracleWBTC is reporting ETH price instead of BTC price

## Summary

USSD's StableOracleWBTC oracle is reporting prices from the [wrong data feed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L17). It is using WETH's feed of `0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419` instead of WBTC's feed of `0xF4030086522a5bEEa4988F8cA5B36dbC97BeE88c` This will obviously cause issues in the protocol around any time the asset WBTC is attempted to be used.

## Vulnerability Detail

Example: Loss of user funds when minting USSD. When users attempt to use WBTC to mint USSD, the number of returned USSD will be much lower than what would be expected since the price lower price of ETH is used to determine the amount of minted USSD. 

## Impact

- Loss of user funds via minting
- Incorrect collateral buyback and selling behaviors including (1) assuming collateral value of held BTC too low (can choose wrong buy-back path) and (2) assuming held BTC collateral is lower in value than what is true, triggering more purchasing of BTC than what is necessary to maintain collateral flutter targets
