# Incorrect oracle address in StableOracleDAI constructor causes erroneous price data or reversions

## Summary

The `StableOracleDAI` has a critical misconfiguration in the constructor where the WBGL/WETH oracle address is mistakenly provided instead of the DAI/ETH oracle address. This issue leads to either incorrect price data return or transaction reversion, thereby destabilizing the USSD ecosystem.

## Vulnerability Detail

The constructor of `StableOracleDAI` is initialized with the WBGL/WETH oracle address `0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e` for `DAIEthOracle`, instead of the DAI/ETH oracle address. As a consequence, the `StableOracleDAI` is unable to retrieve the correct DAI/ETH price information, leading to the malfunctioning of the USSD system.

This misconfiguration can cause the `StableOracleDAI` to return incorrect price data, which could potentially mislead users and disrupt the accurate functioning of the USSD ecosystem. Additionally, it can also cause transactions to revert, affecting the system's reliability and performance.

## Impact

This misconfiguration can severely affect the functionality and stability of the USSD ecosystem. It can lead to significant distortions in price data, resulting in incorrect valuation of assets and possible financial loss to users. Moreover, the system's reliability is undermined by potential transaction reversions, which could reduce trust in the ecosystem.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The constructor of `StableOracleDAI` should be fixed immediately by replacing the WBGL/WETH oracle address with the correct DAI/ETH oracle address (`0x60594a405d53811d3bc4766596efd80fd545a270`). This will ensure that the `StableOracleDAI` can accurately fetch the DAI/ETH price data.
