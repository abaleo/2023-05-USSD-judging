# Incorrect decimals in amountToSellUnits calculation

## Summary
USSDRebalancer.sol#BuyUSSDSellCollateral is used when USSD's price w.r.t. DAI is below a given threshold, thus the system must sell some of its collateral for DAI and then sell such DAI for USSD, pumping its price w.r.t. DAI.
When a given collateral's value is able to cover for the whole amount of DAI to be bought, the system sells just enough of such collateral to cover for such DAI amount. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises in [BuyUSSDSellCollateral#L121](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L121) where the Rebalancer computes the exact amount of collateral to be sold on Uniswap, as `amountToSellUnits`.
This amount should be in the decimal precision of the collateral token being considered at that moment.
In reality, the amount calculated is in `collateral[i].token.decimals - 18` decimal precision. 
Knowing that both `amountToBuyLeftUSD` and `collateralval` are in 18 dp, this line's decimal precision check evaluates to: `collateral[i].token.decimals() * ((1e18 * 1e18 / 1e18) / 1e18) / 1e18 == collateral[i].token.decimals() / 1e18`.
Thus `amountToSellUnits` has 0 decimal precision digits for collateral tokens that use 18 decimals, and is set to `0` for tokens using less.

## Impact
`amountToSellUnits` is then directly passed as an argument to `UniV3SwapInput()`, which sells that exact amount of tokens into Uniswap.
As a consequence, the system will receive much less tokens than expected from the pool, as it has provided such a tiny amount of input tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the calculation of `amountToSellUnits` to:

```diff
- uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
+ uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * (amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18;
```
