# There isn't any redeem function in the code

## Summary
There isn't any `redeem` function in the code, so user will not be able to redeem is collateral back and will be stuck with the USSD tokes forever

## Vulnerability Detail
The code does not include a redeem function, which means there is no mechanism for users to convert or redeem their USSD tokens back into the underlying collateral or any other form of value. This limitation can result in users being unable to liquidate or utilize their USSD tokens, effectively trapping their funds within the token indefinitely.


## Impact
1): Loss of funds for the User.
2): Reputation loss for the protocol
