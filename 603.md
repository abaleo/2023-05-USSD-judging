# Miscalculation for amount of collateral to sell

## Summary
The amountToSellUnits is mistakenly divided by extra 1e^18 (precision) when it shouldn't be.
## Vulnerability Detail
According to this line of code
```solidity
uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
```
(1) amountToBuyLeft is 1e18 precision.
(2) collateralval is also 1e18 precision.
From (1) + (2), the precision of ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18)  gets canceled out.
Hence, the formula is becoming:
IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * (ratio - a very small number compare to 1e18) / 1e18.
While it should be: 
IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * (ratio).
So we can see that the amount is divided by extra 1e18, making the actual amount much smaller than intended.
## Impact
The amount of collateral that the system is trying to sell might be much smaller than intended.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the formula from 
```solidity
uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
```
to 
```solidity
uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) ;
```
