# If a token's oracle goes down, USSDRebalancer.sol.rebalance() function will not work

## Summary
please check Vulnerability Detail.

## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the current implementation, for getting a collateral token's price, the protocol should use Chainlink oracle data feed. but As https://blog.openzeppelin.com/secure-smart-contract-guidelines-the-dangers-of-price-oracles/ mentions, it is possible that Chainlinkâ€™s "immediately block access to price feeds at will". Chainlink has taken oracles offline in extreme cases. For example, during the UST collapse, Chainlink paused the UST/ETH price oracle, to ensure that it wasn't providing inaccurate data to protocols.

In these cases, USSD rebalance by [USSDRebalancer.sol.rebalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L92) will not work.

## Impact
rebalance of USSD may not be possible at a time when the protocol needs collateral price from oracle but token's oracle goes down. As a result, USSD Pegg and De-Pegg (rebalance) process cannot get done.
