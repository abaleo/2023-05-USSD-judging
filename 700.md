# WBGL oracle could be manipulated

## Summary

WBGL oracle could be manipulated.

## Vulnerability Detail

WBGL token is considered one of the protocol collaterals. For its price evaluation in WBGL oracle uses WBGL/WETH UNI pool:
```solidity
    function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
        address[] memory pools = new address[](1);
        pools[0] = 0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e;
        uint256 wbglWethPrice = staticOracleUniV3
            .quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
                1000000000000000000, // 1 Eth
                0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2, // WETH (base token)
                0x2bA64EFB7A4Ec8983E22A49c81fa216AC33f383A, // WBGL (quote token)
                pools, // WBGL/WETH pool uni v3
                600 // period
            );

        uint256 wethPriceUSD = ethOracle.getPriceUSD();

        return (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) / wbglWethPrice;
    }
```

Currently, the liquidity in this pool is only $20k:

Moreover, the oracle uses a narrow time window of just 600 seconds to evaluate prices. The minting function does not restrict minting any amount of USSD if the collateral is allowed token. This implies that an attacker would only need to manipulate the pool's price for 50 blocks to mint a significant number of USSD tokens using the manipulated WBGL price.

## Impact

Low costs of manipulation on WBGL/WETH Unisweap pool could result in minting a significant amount of USSD price, leading to loss of other collateral when the attacker would later dump minted USSD tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider removing the illiquid WBGL tokens from the list of collaterals or adding safety constriction to prevent unlimited minting of USSD using any allowed collateral token.
