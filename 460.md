# Lack of input validation

## Summary

There are no checks in the function _getownvaluation_ to check whether the _unipool_ address is a zero address or it is incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail

    /// @dev get price estimation to DAI using pool address and uniswap price
    function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
      if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) 

AS noticed the _unipool_ address is never checked   meaning there is no check for errors incase an incorrect address was set or it is a zero address.

## Impact
execution of the contract maybe affected.
