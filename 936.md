# Price returned is always zero

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
When converting uniswap price from a Q notation ( eg: sqrtPriceX96 ) to actual value ( sqrtPrice ) you divide the sqrtPriceX96 with the 2^k  ( k being the number after the X.)

```solidity
sqrtPrice = sqrtPriceX96 / 2^96
``` 

In bitwise operations,  >> (SHR),  digits are moved, or shifted, to the right
Eg: 1010 >> 1 = 101 (in decimal: 10 >> 1 = 5)

Note: M >> n is the same as M / 2^n, therefore:

```solidity
10 >> 1 = 10 / 2^1 
``` 
    
 Steps:
Convert from  sqrtPriceX96 to sqrtPrice
Convert sqrtPrice to Price by multiplying by itself (i.e square)
Adjust final price for decimal difference.

So:
```solidity
sqrtPrice = sqrtPriceX96 / 2^96
``` 
 or  
```solidity
sqrtPriceX96 >> 96
```
then 
```solidity
uint256 price = uint256(sqrtPriceX96 >> 96) * uint256(sqrtPriceX96 >> 96)
``` 
However, `getOwnValuation` squares the values first then shifts it with 192. The shift is large such that the value returned will be 0.
```solidity
 price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
``` 
## Impact
price returned is always zero
