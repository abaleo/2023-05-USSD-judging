# no oracle staleness validation

## Summary
Chainlink oracles are used to get prices of assets but without any checks for staleness.

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink oracles are used to get prices of assets but without any checks for staleness.

## Impact
Old prices might lead to too much or too little USSD minted in exchange for collateral. Which in turn might lead to unfair rebalances that will damage the peg to DAI.
