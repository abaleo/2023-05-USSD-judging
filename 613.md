# USSD Protocol could be paused from outside, contrary to protocol's assumption

## Summary
USSD Protocol mentions that they don't expect to be paused from outside, however, their token integrations (WBGL, WBTC) would allow external parties to do so.

## Vulnerability Detail
USSD mentions explicitly that they don't expect for contracts activity to be paused from outside here

However, since they integrate pausable tokens such as WBGL, WBTC, the USSD protocol could be paused from outside.
WBTC : https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599#code
WBGL : https://etherscan.io/address/0xbaa1f3257d808c5078f25e8405da4a703485eb3e#code

If any of these tokens are paused, transfers of these tokens won't work, hence all actions (mint, rebalance) involving these tokens would revert, effectively pausing the protocol.

## Impact
The protocol could be halted contrary to the protocol's belief

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider writing a wrapper around these pausable tokens, so even if the native token is paused, users can transfer the wrapped tokens.
