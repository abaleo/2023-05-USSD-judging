# Use of Uniswap v3 pool token balances can be manipulated by calling `UniswapV3Pool::flash` which alters the return value of `USSDRebalancer::getSupplyProportion` and thus can be exploited by an attacker to profit at the expense of the protocol and its users

## Summary
The `USSDRebalancer::getSupplyProportion` function uses token balances to calculate the supply proportion of the pool. However, token balances can be manipulated by flash loaning funds from the pool, causing the rebalancer to return an incorrect supply proportion. This can be exploited by an attacker to profit at the expense of the protocol and its users.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following attack:
* An attacker takes a flash loan from the Uniswap v3 pool by calling `UniswapV3Pool::flash` which modifies token balances when [executing transfers](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L805-L806).
* The attacker calls rebalance with the modified token balances, causing `USSDRebalancer::getSupplyProportion` to return a value that is different from the pool's actual liquidity reserves (including those for which the attacker temporarily has ownership but will be repaid atomically)/
* The attacker repays the flash loan and the balances are restored.
* The attacker can now arbitrage the protocol for a profit as described by [inline](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L100-L101) [comments](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L143-L144).

## Impact
An attacker could profit at the expense of the protocol and its users by temporarily manipulating the pool balances which has a direct and significant impact on the rebalancing logic.

## Recommendation
Use Uniswap v3 pool liquidity reserves instead of token balances when calculating the supply proportion.
