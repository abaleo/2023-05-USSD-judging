# StableOracleWBTC - price feed used is for ETH - USD

## Summary
The hardcoded address used for the price feed is mistakenly set to the the one for weth/usd.

## Vulnerability Detail
The price feed is set in the constructor to a wrong address:
```solidity
constructor() {
	priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
		0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419
	);
}
```

This address is the price feed for weth/usd, the right address is in the comments from lines 8 - 11:
```solidity
/*
    wbtc 0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599;
    chainlink btc/usd priceFeed 0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c;
*/
```

## Impact
High, because the prices returned are from weth, which has a value around 15 times smaller than wbtc, and this would affect the whole rebalancing process.
