# BTC/USD chainlink oracle is used to price WBTC which is problematic for rebalancing if WBTC depegs

## Summary

The BTC/USD chainlink oracle is used to price WBTC. Since WBTC is a bridged asset, if the bridge gets compromised/hacked, the price of WBTC will depag and will no longer be equal to the price of BTC.  

## Vulnerability Detail

If a depeg described in the summary happens, the calculation of `collateralFactor` will be to high since it assumes that the WBTC held by the USSD contract is worth more than it actually is. Depending on the calculated `collateralFactor` and the current collateral holding of USSD this can lead to the contract buying worthless WBTC when rebalancing. 

## Impact

USSD will increase its worthless WBTC holdings instead of buying “good” collateral when rebalancing

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Using a double oracle setup like both the Chainlink and another on-chain liquidity base oracle (i.e. UniV3 TWAP) could fix the problem. If the price of the on-chain liquidity oracle drops below a certain threshold of the Chainlink oracles (i.e. 2% lower), buying of WBTC could be skipped when rebalancing. The chainlink oracle will prevent price manipulation and the liquidity oracle will safeguard against the asset depegging.
