# When rebalancing and buying collateral, the DAI collateral is bought even though it should not

## Summary

When buying collateral, the USSDRebalancer tries to swap DAI to DAI, even though it does not intend to do it.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `USSDRebalancer.SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function, after buying DAI, the DAI amount will be swapped to different collateral assets to increase their balance. The DAI is not supposed to be swapped because it is already DAI. However, the function still attempts to swap it:

        if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {
            // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);

The condition `collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()` will always be true because the collateral address only needs to be different from one token in the pool, and it always is. Therefore, the function will try to swap the DAI. If the pathbuy is not specified then the function will revert.

## Impact

The `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function will not work as intended and may revert.

## Recommendation

Update the condition:

```diff
-    if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {
+    if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() && collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {
```
