# Initial USSD mint is unbacked.

## Summary 

Initial USSD mint is unbacked.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the whitepaper, it states that there will be an initial USSD mint of 1000 tokens for supplying initial liquidity. These tokens are supposed to be backed by collateral of 1000 DAI.

In the `initialize` function, 10,000 tokens (rather than the stated 1000) are minted, and there is no corresponding deposit of DAI collateral at all. These tokens are totally unbacked.

## Impact

This initial mint breaks protocol rules around collateralization. These tokens are effectively worthless, and there is no way for the protocol to rebalance in the event of a peg loss since there is no collateral in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The initialize function should probably be calling `mintForToken` rather than simply `_mint` so that there is a requirement that DAI be deposited. Or don't mint anything internally within the initializer and simply mint the initial tokens the normal way with `mintForToken`.
