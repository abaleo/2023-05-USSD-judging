# Rebalancer logic is based on uniswap v2 behaviour instead of v3

## Summary

The rebalancer uses the balance of DAI and USSD to determine the amount to be rebalanced. This would work with a uniswap v2 liquidity pool, with uniswap v3 that might be incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail

The DAI <> USSD liquidity pool is initialized to have an equal proportion of DAI and USSD, and the liquidity range in the test is specified to be between 0.01 and 100. Once created, there is nothing preventing users to provide more liquidity to the pool. They can also choose their range of liquidity. While rebalancing, the function `getSupplyProportion()` is used to determine the balance of both assets, the difference between both is then used to decide wether to rebalance or not and how much. The problem is that it assumes that the liquidity is provided with a single tick interval.

## Impact

By providing liquidity with different tick intervals it impacts the accounting of the rebalancer. We might think of the following scenarios:

scenario 1:
1. `getOwnValuation() < 1e6 - threshold`
2. Attacker provide liquidity only in DAI outside of the current liquidity range, it increase the amount of DAI in the pool but the `getOwnValuation()` is not impacted
3. Attacker call `rebalance()`
4. `mintRebalancer()` mint more token than it should
5. Attacker withdraw its liquidity

scenario 2:
1. `getOwnValuation() > 1e6 + threshold`
2. Attacker provide liquidity only in DAI outside of the current liquidity range it increase the amount of DAI in the pool but the `getOwnValuation()` is not impacted
3. we have a denial of service on `rebalance()`  because `(USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)` is a negative number so the function reverts

We can think of other similar scenario but with USSD instead of DAI

```solidity
function rebalance() override public {
  uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation();
  (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
  if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
    // peg-down recovery
    BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
  } else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
    // mint and buy collateral
    // never sell too much USSD for DAI so it 'overshoots' (becomes more in quantity than DAI on the pool)
    // otherwise could be arbitraged through mint/redeem
    // the execution difference due to fee should be taken into accounting too
    // take 1% safety margin (estimated as 2 x 0.5% fee)
    IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100); // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
    SellUSSDBuyCollateral();
  }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use uniswap v2 pool instead of uniswap v3 pool or change the math to not use the total balance.
