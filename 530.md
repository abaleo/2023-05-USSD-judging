# Lack of access control for USSD#mintRebalancer and USSD#burnRebalancer

## Summary
Lack of access control for USSD#mintRebalancer and USSD#burnRebalancer. 
## Vulnerability Detail

`mintRebalancer()` and `burnRebalancer()` are functions in USSD contract in order to mint and burn USSD token for the contract address itself. These functions are supposed to be called by the `USSDRebalancer` contract only. However, leaving these functions public exposes to attackers to manipulate the amount of USSD tokens held by the contract.

## Impact
There are several possible impacts:

1. Attacker can mint a number of tokens close to uint256-max number. Therefore all the minting operation after that will cause `totalSupply` overflow, causing the tx to be failed.
2. The function `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` in `USSDRebalancer` contract selling all the amount of USSD tokens in the USSD contract itself. If the attacker mint a lot of token then call the `rebalancer()` function, the contract will create a huge sell pressure on the USSD/DAI pair, causing the price of USSD crash to zero.

## Recommendation
Add `onlyBalancer` modifier to these functions
