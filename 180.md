# Potential Sandwich Attack Due to Minimum Output Amount Set to Zero

## Summary

The function USSD#UniV3SwapInput is susceptible to sandwich attacks due to its minimum output amount (amountOutMinimum) being set to zero. This configuration could potentially enable attackers to manipulate transaction order, thereby sandwiching a user's trades between their own. Consequently, this could result in a total loss of funds for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the UniV3SwapInput function, an ExactInputParams structure is accepted, wherein the amountOutMinimum is hardcoded to 0. This scenario is problematic as it eliminates a lower bound for the trade output, thereby paving the way for possible sandwich attacks. This vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious entity due to the lack of minimum output enforcement.

A sandwich attack occurs when an attacker identifies a transaction in the mempool and creates a higher gas-price transaction to precede it. This action artificially inflates the token's price. Subsequently, the attacker initiates another transaction to sell the token immediately after the victim's transaction is confirmed, thereby benefiting from the artificially elevated price at the victim's expense.

## Impact

Users are at risk of losing 100% of their funds should a successful sandwich attack occur.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's recommended to not hardcode the amountOutMinimum to 0 in the UniV3SwapInput function. Instead, users or the contract itself should specify a minimum output amount that is acceptable for the trade.
