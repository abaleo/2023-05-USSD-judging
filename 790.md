# Incorrect check on collateral being `DAI` in `USSDRebalancer.SellUSSDBuyCollateral()`

## Summary
In `USSDRebalancer.SellUSSDBuyCollateral()`, `DAI` should not be swapped for `DAI` as the other collaterals because it is already inside the contract. An incorrect check causes it ito be swapped as the other collaterals.

## Vulnerability Detail
The check

```solidity
if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1())
```
should return false if the collateral is either USSD or DAI, but it's always true.

`IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput()` will be called with `DAI` and no matter what `collateral[i].pathbuy` is this is an issue since the call will either revert or swap some tokens when no swap should be executed.

## Impact
Rebalanicing mechanism will either fail or swap an excess amount of tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `&&` instead of `||`:

```diff
-if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1())
+if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() && collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1())
```
