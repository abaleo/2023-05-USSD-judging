# Relayer could be minted 10k tokens on USSD initialization

## Summary
A relayer could be minted 10k tokens during a call to `USSD::initialize` due to incorrect usage of OpenZeppelin context function `_msgSender()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`USSD` uses OpenZeppelin context `_msgSender()` within calls to `initialize`. However, raw `msg.sender` is passed to the internal `USSD::_mint` function which mints the sender 10k tokens. If the original sender executed this call via a relayer then it would be the relayer who receives these newly minted tokens.

## Impact
The sender will not receive the newly minted tokens, as is the intention.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either remove the use of `_msgSender()` if a relayer is not intended to be used (the only usage is in both `USSD::initialize` and `USSDRebalancer::initialize`) or if use of a relayer is desired then ensure the context function is used everywhere, in place of raw `msg.sender`.
