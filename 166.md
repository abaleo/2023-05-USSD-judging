# Invalid ethOracle contract address in `getPriceUSD` Function

## Summary
Without a valid oracle contract for obtaining the USD price of WETH, the calculation of the USD price for the specific token cannot be completed accurately. As a result, the returned value from the getPriceUSD() function may be incorrect or unreliable.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `StableOracleDAI.ethOracle` variable is assigned the address of the IStableOracle contract(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) during the initialization of the constructor.The `getPriceUSD()` function relies on the ethOracle contract to provide the USD price of WETH (Wrapped Ether). However, since the ethOracle contract address is set to 0, it means there is no valid oracle contract to retrieve the price data from.As a result, calling the getPriceUSD() function may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
```solidity
    constructor() {
        priceFeedDAIETH = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4
        );
        DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e
        );
        ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000); // TODO: WETH oracle price
    }
```
## Impact
 calling the getPriceUSD() function may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The ethOracle contract should be properly initialized with a valid contract address that provides accurate price data for WETH in USD.
