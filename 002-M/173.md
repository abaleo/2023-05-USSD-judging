# Check for stale data before trusting Chainlink's response

## Summary
Lack of  checks for round completeness may result in the utilization of stale prices, leading to incorrect price return values or outdated pricing information. Consequently, functions that depend on accurate price feeds may not operate as intended, potentially resulting in financial losses.
## Vulnerability Detail
While Chainlinks' ```latestRoundData()``` function is used along with other oracles in [StablOracleDAI.sol](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol), in [StablOracleWBTC.sol](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol) and [StableOracleWETH.sol](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol) it is used as an only source for getting real world price. The problem though lies in the usage of this function. 
As Chainlink [recommends](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds):
> Your application should track the latestTimestamp variable or use the updatedAt value from the latestRoundData() function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it. If your application detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat or within time limits that you determine are acceptable for your application, pause operation or switch to an alternate operation mode while identifying the cause of the delay.


So it is recommended to use extra informations provided in ```latestRoundData``` function, such as:
- If ```answeredInRound``` is less than roundId, the answer is being carried over.
- A ```timestamp``` with zero value means the round is not complete and should not be used.

## Impact
Functions that depend on accurate price feeds may not operate as intended, potentially resulting in financial losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of just taking ```price``` from Chainlinks' ```latestRoundData()``` function, get all return values as commented out in [StableOracleDAI.sol#L47](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L48)
```solidity
//(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```
and to make sure that the data is not stale, use checks such as:
```solidity
require(timeStamp != 0);
require(answeredInRound >= roundID);
```
before returning ```price```.
