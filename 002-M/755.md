# Missing Sanity Checks on returned Chainlink Price Feed data

## Summary

Currently there is no sanity checking inside of USSD's oracles that Chainlink's price feeds are currently operational. Meaning, if Chainlink has issues, the protocol will continue to run with stale prices. Most calls to the oracle look like this:
```solidity
 (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```
This is problematic because there is no checking that the returned price was updated recently. Chainlink's price feed infrastructure's `latestRoundData()` returns auxiliary data besides just a price for an asset. The API also returns an `updatedAt` timestamp value the SHOULD be checked for staleness. 

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Chainlink suffers an outage
2. There is no checking on price feed staleness in the oracles
3. Users can arbitrage the protocol's stale prices through various routes like claiming USSD with the stale values and redeeming for DAI in the DAI:USSD uniswap pool

## Impact

Can cause protocol to loose funds unnecessarily. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add easy sanity checking that the price isn't older than at least the price feed's heartbeat listed [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses).
