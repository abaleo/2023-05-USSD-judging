# Chainlink's latestRoundData return stale or incorrect result

## Summary
The project relies on using oracles' data to do the protocol operations. Some of those oracles use the Chainlink's `latestRoundData` function but they don't check the return for stale or incorrect results.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the files `StableOracleDAI.sol`, `StableOracleWBTC.sol` and  `StableOracleWETH.sol`; the protocol is using the Chainlink's `latestRoundData` function to get the latest USD price. But it is not checking if the returned value indicates stale data.

This could lead to stale prices according to the [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data).

In the pass other projects have had similar reports like this one: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-fairside-findings/issues/70

## Impact
Having stale data can lead to wrong calculations and a bad logic behavior.

In  `StableOracleWETH.sol`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol#L23

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add checks on the return data with proper revert messages if the price is stale or the round is uncomplete, for example:
```solidity
(uint80 roundID, int256 price, , uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "...");
require(timeStamp != 0, "...");
```
