# Chainlink price feed is not sufficiently validated and can return stale price

## Summary
The protocol is using `latestRoundData()` to retrieve Chainlink prices, but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data.

## Vulnerability Detail
Across these contracts, `StableOracleDAI`, `StableOracleWBTC`, and `StableOracleWETH`, you are using Chainlink's `latestRoundData()`, but they are merely retrieving `int256 price`. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:

[Historical Price data](https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds)

## Impact
The result of `latestRoundData` API will be used across function `getPriceUSD` where a stale price from Chainlink can lead to loss of funds to end-users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the missing checks for stale data.

For example:

```solidity
(uint80 roundID , int price, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = pricefeed.latestRoundData();

require(price > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0"); 
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete");
```
