# Chainlink price feed requests lack proper checks

## Summary

Medium Severity

## Vulnerability Detail

The ChainlinkPriceFeed aggregators are used in `StableOracleDAI.sol`, `StableOracleWETH.sol`, `StableOracleWBTC.sol` and by extension `StableOracleWBGL.sol` contracts. 

The function `latestRoundData()` returns the price which is later used in calculating the `USD` value of the given collateral assets, however in all those contracts there is lack of security checks for the retrieved price.

```solidity 
(, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```

## Impact

A potentially returned `0` price or a stale price could impact the overall stability of USSD, as the `getPriceUSD()` function is invoked during regular operations both in `USSD.sol` and `USSDRebalancer.sol`.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Fetch also the `updatedAt` from the `latestRoundData()` call as follows:

```solidity
(, int256 price, ,uint256 updatedAt , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```

Make sure to include a `constant` variable `TIMEOUT`, which will be used to make the check that the price returned is not a stale price. You have set the value of `TIMEOUT` to any reasonable timeframe (as example 3 hours):

```solidity
uint256 internal constant TIMEOUT = 10800;
```

After requesting the price make security checks that the retrieved price is not `0` or a stale price: 

```solidity
require(price > 0 && block.timestamp - updatedAt <  TIMEOUT);
```
