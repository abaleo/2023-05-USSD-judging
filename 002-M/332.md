# Loss of funds of the market pool due to unsafe type casting of Price Value

## Summary
When price can be a negative number as it is retrieved from a oracle pricefeed, the unsafe type casting from int256 to uint256 will result in a huge number close to 2**255 which will due to overflow calculateMint() and collateralFactor() function , when multiplied by amount at calculateMint() and collateralFactor()  function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol might loss its funds if the oracle.getPriceUsd returns a overflowed value due to unsafe type castings in the oracles.

## Impact
The protocol might loss its funds

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Even though Solidity 0.8.x is used, type casts do not throw an error.
A SafeCast library must be used everywhere a typecast is done.
