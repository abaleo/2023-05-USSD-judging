# Lack of Chainlink price feed data validation

## Summary

Lack of Chainlink price feed data validation.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is not checked that the `price` value returned by `priceFeed.latestRoundData()` is in a specific range. Chainlink aggregator could send a wrong value. Although this is unlikely, given the crucial impact that this would have in the protocol, a safety check should be added to the received price value.
In the case of a negative value received for `price`, casting the value to a `uint256` would cause the value to overflow.

## Impact

In the case of a wrong price being received by Chainlink's aggregator, the whole rebalancing and minting functionalities would be broken and USSD would lose its peg.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```solidity
(, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
if (price < minPrice || price > maxPrice) {
    // Call an alternative price source or pause the protocol
}
```
