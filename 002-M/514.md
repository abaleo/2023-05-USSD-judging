# Chainlink oracle data feed can be outdated yet used anyway

## Summary
The chainlink oracle feed is wrongly integrated as there is no check if the price returned is outdated.

## Vulnerability Detail
The StableOracles* could use outdated price coming from chainlink as there is no protection against stalled prices.
Namely: 
StableOracleDAI
StableOracleWBTC
StableOracleWETH

## Impact
The retrieved price of the priceFeed can be outdated and used anyways as a valid data because no timestamp tolerance of the update source time is checked while using the return parameter (price) of feed.latestRoundData()

## Code Snippet
```solidity
(, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
// chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD
return uint256(price) * 1e10;
```
