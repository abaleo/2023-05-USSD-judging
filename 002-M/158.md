# Chainlink's latestRoundData return stale or incorrect result

## Summary
No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price. The functions rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, sometimes can lead to fund loss.
## Vulnerability Detail
The oracle `getPriceUSD()` call out to an oracle with latestRoundData() to get the price of some token. there is no check if the return value indicates stale data.

According to Chainlink's documentation, this function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0 or outdated round data. The external Chainlink oracle, which provides index price information to the system, introduces risk inherent to any dependency on third-party data sources. For example, the oracle could fall behind or otherwise fail to be maintained, resulting in outdated data being fed to the index price calculations. Oracle reliance has historically resulted in crippled on-chain systems, and complications that lead to these outcomes can arise from things as simple as network congestion.

```solidity
 function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
        address[] memory pools = new address[](1);
        pools[0] = 0x60594a405d53811d3BC4766596EFD80fd545A270;
        uint256 DAIWethPrice = DAIEthOracle.quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
            1000000000000000000, // 1 Eth
            0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2, // WETH (base token)
            0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F, // DAI (quote token)
            pools, // DAI/WETH pool uni v3
            600 // period
        );

        uint256 wethPriceUSD = ethOracle.getPriceUSD();

        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD, so multiply by 10 decimals to get 18 decimal fractional
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();

        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
    }
```

## Impact
If there is a problem with chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).

This could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price.

As a result, the functions rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, sometimes can lead to fund loss. The impacts vary and depends on the specific situation like the following:

incorrect liquidation
some users could be liquidated when they should not
no liquidation is performed when there should be
wrong price feed
causing inappropriate loan being taken, beyond the current collateral factor
too low price feed affect normal bor

## Recommendation
Add the below check for returned data


```solidity
 (uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 timestamp, uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
        //Solution
        require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(price> 0,"Chainlink answer reporting 0");

        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert PRICE_OUTDATED(_token);
```
