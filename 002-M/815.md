# chainLink call not properly sanitized, it can return stale data

## Summary
The USSD ecosystem ( USSD & USSDRebalancer ) are using oracles to fetch prices of certain assets in USD, those oracles are on their own calling chainlink price feed and after that performing some calculating on the chainlink price feed results, there are no check on the output of the chain price feeds to ensure that data returned is not stale.
## Vulnerability Detail
Inside the following oracles  [StableOracleDAI](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#LL48C12-L48C12), [StableOracleWBTC](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L12) and [StableOracleWETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol#L23), there is a call performed to fetch the price from the chainLink price feeds, that call is not sanitized correctly as it can return stale data and the contract have no way of identifying it.

## Impact
The oracle will use stale data when performing it's operation, creating an incorrect output that will be later used by USSD & USSDRebalancer in their operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if the returned data is staled by adding the following modifications where you are fetch the price from ChainLink

```solidity
(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 timestamp, uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
//fix:
        require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(answer > 0,"Chainlink answer reporting 0");

        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert PRICE_OUTDATED(_token);
```
