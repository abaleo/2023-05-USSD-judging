# Chainlink's `latestRoundData` could return stale or incorrect result (and no implemention of try-catch block)

## Summary
1. Chainlink's latestRoundData() is used but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:

https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds

2. It is recommended to have latestRoundData function call in a try-catch block, as multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will.

## Vulnerability Detail

This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding checks for stale data. Please review my below code for example, and make changes that suit you.

```solidity
        (uint80 roundID, int256 answer, uint256 timestamp, uint256 updatedAt, ) = registry.latestRoundData(
            token,
            USD
        );
        require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(answer > 0,"Chainlink answer reporting 0");
```
