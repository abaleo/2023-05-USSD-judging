# Missing checks will return  stale or 0 price

## Summary
Throughout the protocol fetching the price of an asset occurs however it is missing multiple checks to ensure the price is accurate and valid. These missing checks will lead to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();

        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
    }

```
Not doing these checks can lead to a stale price being returned or returning 0 according to chainlink documentation: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data


## Impact
Great chance of returning a stale price or potentially 0. This will lead to incorrect calculations throughout the protocol and overall loss of funds. 

Because there are no checks at all on price the the effects will be felt throughout the protocol I feel this issue is a high.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
adding these checks will prevent the return of a stale price or 0. 
```solidity
        require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(answer > 0,"Chainlink answer reporting 0");

        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime)
            revert PRICE_OUTDATED(_token);

```
