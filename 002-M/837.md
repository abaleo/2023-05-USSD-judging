# latestRoundData() can return stale or incorrect result

## Summary
The function getPriceUSD in the StableOracleWBTC and StableOracleWETH contract's doesn't contain checks for the returned price (if its equal to zero or not) and round completeness and timestamp, which could lead to returning a stale or wrong price and thus the protocol functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected and sometimes can lead to a loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
If there is a problem with chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).
This could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change function getPriceUSD() in  the StableOracleWBTC and StableOracleWETH contract's
to :
```diff
 function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
+  (uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
- (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
// @audit Add the required checks:
+ require(price> 0,"Negative Oracle Price");
+ require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "round not complete");
+ require(timeStamp != 0, "Round not complete");
// chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD
        return uint256(price) * 1e10;
}
```
