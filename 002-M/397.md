# Returned values of Chainlink Oracle are not verified

## Summary

Chainlink Oracle returned values are not handled properly.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink oracle return values are not handled properly, the priceFeed will return the following variables:

- roundId
- answer
- startedAt
- updatedAt
- answeredInRound

These returned values are meant to be used to do some extra checks before updating the price. By just using the answer, the contract may get stale prices and incomplete rounds.

## Impact

If there is a problem with Chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. Chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system), consumers of this contract may continue using outdated, stale or incorrect data (if oracles are unable to submit, no new round is started).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add validation for example in StableOracleDAI:

```diff
-   (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
+   (uint80 roundID, int256 price, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
+   require(answer > 0, "" Chainlink price <= 0"");
+   require(answeredInRound >= roundID , "" Stale price "");
+   require(timestamp != 0, "" Round not complete "");"
```
