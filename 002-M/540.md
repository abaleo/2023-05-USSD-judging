# latestTimestamp is not checked in Oracles

## Summary
`latestTimestamp` is not checked 

## Vulnerability Detail
Due to the nature of data feeds, they can be altered by extreme events. Chainlink developers strongly recommend using their data feeds cautiously and setting limitations to the received `latestTimestamp`.

> Your application should track the latestTimestamp variable or use the updatedAt value from the latestRoundData() function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it. If your application detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat or within time limits that you determine are acceptable for your application, pause operation or switch to an alternate operation mode while identifying the cause of the delay.

> When you build applications and protocols that depend on data feeds, include monitoring and safeguards to protect against the negative impact of extreme market events, possible malicious activity on third-party venues or contracts, potential delays, and outages.

*Quote from the Chainlink documentation*

## Impact
In case of an extreme situation, there is a probability of miscalculation of the prices, which leads to incorrect calculations of the USSD price. This will cause instability of the protocol and potential loss of funds for the holders.
