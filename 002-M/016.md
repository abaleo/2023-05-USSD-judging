# The `Chainlink` price feed's input is not validated and `latestRoundData()` has no check for round completeness.

https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L48

## Summary
There is no check in the` getPriceUSD()` function of the oracles for round completeness, or the returned `timestamp`, and this could lead to stale, outdated, or wrong price return value, which could affect other functions that depend on the `getPriceUSD()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue occurs in the following Oracle contracts respectively.
`contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol`

 `contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol `
[Lines of code](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol#LL21C1-L26C6)
**Sample of the code.**
 ```solidity
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
    //@audit no check for `latestRoundData` if it's zero or a negative number.
   //@audit no check for `latestRoundData` for the returned timestamp.
        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
 ```
 
 
as seen in the code above the returned `timestamp` is not checked, and there is no check for `round completeness`.
 ```solidity
   function calculateMint(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
//@audit here it calls the getPriceUSD function.
        uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)].oracle.getPriceUSD();
        return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());
 ```
`USSD.sol`
The `calculateMint` function could malfunction and be exploited due to incorrect values that can be gotten from the `getPriceUSD() ` function from the  `Oracle `.

According to `Chainlink's` documentation, this function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0 or  `outdated` round data. The external `Chainlink oracle`, which provides index price information to the system, introduces risk inherent to any dependency on  `third-party ` data sources. For example, the `oracle` could fall behind or otherwise fail to be maintained, resulting in  `outdated ` data being fed to the index price calculations. `Oracle's ` reliance has historically resulted in crippled  `on-chain systems `, and complications that lead to these outcomes can arise from things as simple as  `network congestion `.

## Impact
This could lead to `stale prices` and wrong price return value, or `outdated` prices.
As a result, the functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected due to wrong calculations made with stale prices, which sometimes can lead to fund loss. The impacts vary and depend on specific situations.

## Tool used

`Manual Review`

## Recommendation
`Validate` data feed for round `completeness ` and for  returned `timestamp`

An instance of `Validation` with code
```solidity
       - (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
       + (, int256 exchangeRate, , uint256 updatedAt , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
       + if(price <= 0) revert ZeroExchangeRate.
       + if(if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - 60 * 60 /* 1 hour */) {
       +   revert OutdatedTimestamp();
       +}
        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```
