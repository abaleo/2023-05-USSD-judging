# Chainlink price feed data could be stale

## Summary

Chainlink price feed data could be stale.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is not checked that the `updatedAt` value returned by `priceFeed.latestRoundData()` is recent enough. This can lead to the use of outdated price data.

As per [Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-timestamp-of-the-latest-answer):
> Your application should track the latestTimestamp variable or use the updatedAt value from the latestRoundData() function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it. If your application detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat or within time limits that you determine are acceptable for your application, pause operation or switch to an alternate operation mode while identifying the cause of the delay.

## Impact

`USSD.sol:mintForToken()` will mint an incorrect amount of USSD tokens.

The rebalance functionality will not work as expected, as the amounts to be swapped in `USSDRebalancer.sol:SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` and `USSDRebalancer.sol:BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` will be incorrect.

## Recommendation

```solidity
(, int256 price, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
if (block.timestamp - updatedAt > validPeriod) {
    // Call an alternative price source or pause the protocol
}
```
