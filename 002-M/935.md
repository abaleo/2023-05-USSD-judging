# Lack of checking whether the calculations are based on fresh data from chainlink.

## Summary
The data returned by chainlink may not be up-to-date, which will result in an incorrect calculation of the ETH price.

## Vulnerability Detail
Following the chainlink contract documentation:
"Consumers are encouraged to check that they're receiving fresh data by inspecting the updatedAt and answeredInRound return values."

## Impact
The price returned by the internal DAI oracle (StableOracleDAI.sol) will be incorrect

```solidity
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Additional data returned from chainlink should be checked for data freshness. Additionally, depending on the assumptions of the project, you can add a certain delay that will be tolerated (`stalePriceDelay`).
