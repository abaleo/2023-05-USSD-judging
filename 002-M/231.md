# Lack of validation for Chainlink price feed timestamps allow outdated prices to be used

## Summary

With Chainlink price feeds, `latestRoundData` is being used, but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data.

## Vulnerability Detail

The return values provided by the `latestRoundData` function on Chainlink price feeds includes information that allows the caller to perform basic checks to ensure that the price is valid and fresh.

```solididy
function latestRoundData() external view
    returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    )
```

However, the oracles are not currently verifying what is returned. Basic checks need to be in place to validate the price.

- `answeredInRound` should not be less than `roundId`
- `updatedAt` should be within a reasonable time frame

## Impact

The prices returned by the oracle should represent the current market. 

If prices are stale, the rebalancer cannot accurately calculate the value of assets. This can lead to the rebalancer buying or selling assets at the wrong price, leaking value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include additional checks to ensure that the price is fresh. For example...

```solidity
    (uint80 roundId, int256 price,,,uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
    if (answeredInRound < roundID) revert RoundIDOutdated();
    if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - LIMIT) revert PriceOutdated();
```
