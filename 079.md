# Missing work address for ethOracle

## Summary
In `StableOracleDAI.sol` the variable `ethOracle` is supposed to be set inside the constructor. However no real value is ever set. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently the constructor has this: 
`ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000); // TODO: WETH oracle price` 
with the incomplete constructor the protocol will not work because ethOracle will fail in its current state. 
## Impact
Protocol will not work

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Finish setting a valid address for `ethOracle` by finishing the TODO that was already in place.
