# The address in the `StableOracleWBTC.sol` is wrong which would give the wrong price when the oracle is called

## Summary
The constructor in the `StableOracleWBTC.sol` creates a `AggregatorV3Interface` from Chainlink , to get the price of BTC/USD, but the address used is the ETH/USD one.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `StableOracleWBTC.sol` is used as an oracle to get the price of the collateral used for USSD, but in the address used in the constructor is the address of the ETH/USD instead of the BTC/USD one, so anytime the function `getPriceUSD` is called for WBTC, the oracle will give the price of ETH instead of BTC which would mess up the price calculation.
## Impact
The impact is a High one since the calculations will always be off and there is no way to change the address of the oracle.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the address in the constructor with the one that checks the price of BTC/USD, which is the `0xF4030086522a5bEEa4988F8cA5B36dbC97BeE88c` address.
