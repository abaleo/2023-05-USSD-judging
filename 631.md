# Incorrect arithmetic operation

## Summary
In `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function, a calculation to sell collateral to buy USSD is incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail
The parameter `amountToBuy` is the amount represented with 6 decimals. Inside the function, it is converted to 18 decimals and assigned to `amountToBuyLeftUSD`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L116

In `for` loop, `collateralval` is calculated to represent the value of collateral in USD with 18 decimals.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L121

And then `amountToSellUnits` is calculated as `balance * amountToBuyLeftUSD  / collateralval / 1e18`, which is wrong because division by `1e18` is not needed.
Both `amountToBuyLeftUSD` and `collateralval` are 18 decimals, so when we want to calculate the portion, just `balance * amountToBuyLeftUSD / collateralval` is enough.

## Impact
This issue directly impacts rebalancing mechanism which is the most important part of the project, which will cause the contract not recover when the price pegs down.

## Recommendation

Replace this line with following one:
`uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * amountToBuyLeftUSD / collateralval;`
