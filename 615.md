# Wrong address for btc/usd price oracle in the `StableOracleWBTC` contract

## Summary

Inside of the `StableOracleWBTC` contract's constructor, the `priceFeed` field is being initialized with a wrong address.

## Vulnerability Detail 

The address value that is being assigned to the `priceFeed` field is not the correct one. Instead of providing the address of the wbtc/usd Chainlink oracle, we are actually providing the one of the weth/usd oracle.

```solidity
constructor() {
    priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
        0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419 // <- weth/usd oracle address
    );
}
```

## Impact

If the issue goes unnoticed after the contract deployment, it can leave the token and it's holders with tremendous loses (since as we know, the difference between the price of Ether and the price of Bitcoin is quite big).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 

Change the hard-coded address value to `0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c` - the address of the wbtc/usd Chainlink price feed.
