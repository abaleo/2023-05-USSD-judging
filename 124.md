# StableOracleWBTC() uses BTC pricefeed for WBTC

## Summary
If WBTC were to depeg (compromised/ fail/ etc) there will be a price discrepancy that the contract will not be able to handle resulting in users being able to mint USSD in exchange for a compromised WBTC 


## Vulnerability Detail
The chain link btc/usd oracle is used to price WBTC. Because WBTC is a bridged asset and has the potential to depeg from BTC for a variety of reasons the price returned from the BTC price feed would be inaccurate. This can allow users to use worthless/comprimised wbtc to mint USSD. This is possible because the price feed of BTC is fine so the protocol will think that wbtc is worth the same as btc. Which in some cases will not be the case.

## Recommendation
Using a double oracle setup would mitigate this. adding another oracle like a TWAP or one that is liquidity based. This way if there is a unacceptable deviation between the two oracles you can stop certain operations. This way if/when there is a de-pegging the liquidity oracle will prevent users from taking advantage of WBTC de-pegging
