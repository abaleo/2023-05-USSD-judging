# Lack of access control in burnRebalancer allows any user to burn their USSD

## Summary
Function `burnRebalancer` has no access control, so anyone can send their `USSD` to the `USSD` contract and burn them, affecting the supply.

## Vulnerability Detail
`USSD` contract has a `onlyBalancer` modifier which is used only to guarantee that function `UniV3SwapInput` is called from the rebalancer, but should also be used in function `burnRebalancer`.

## Impact
Medium, burning tokens should only be allowed to the `USSDBalancer` contract.

## Tool used
Manual review.


## Recommendation
Use the `onlyBalancer` modifier in function `burnRebalancer`.
