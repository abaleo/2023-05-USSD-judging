# Uniswap no slippage protection

## Summary

When rebalance, uniswap3 is utilized for token swap, but no slippage protection.    

## Vulnerability Detail

Malicious users can use sandwich attack arbitrage, which not only has MEV, but also disables rebalance.   
Simple simulation arbitrage is as follows:    
1. The initial pool ratio is USSD:DAI 100:10
2. After a user swaps, the ratio is DAI 200:50     
3. The watchdog triggers the rebalance and purchases USSD using 50 DAI. The final pool should have been USSD:DAI 100:100    
4. Malicious users frontrun and continue to push up USSD prices. FlashLoan  950 DAI to buy a lot of USSD, pool ratio at USSD:DAI 10:1000
5. rebalance logic is executed. 50 DAI purchases 0 USSD and pool ratio USSD:DAI10:1050
6. The malicious user sells 190 USSD, pays for flash loan and arbitrage 50 DAI, and the final pool ratio is USSD:DAI 200:50
7. Continue to rebalance, and soon the collateral will be run out.

```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
