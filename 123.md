# rebalance process incase of buying the collateral, could revert caused by incorrect condition check

## Summary

rebalance process, will try to buy the collateral incase of `ownval > 1e6 + threshold`.  However, the process can revert caused by incorrect condition check.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside `rebalance()` call, if `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` is triggered, it will eventually try to buy the current collateral to `baseAsset`. However, the condition check to operate swap is incorrect and will allow `UniV3SwapInput()` to be called even for DAI collateral (`baseAsset`).

```solidity
          if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) { // @audit - incorrect, should use logical && operator
            // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
          }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the operator to use logical `&&` :

```solidity
          if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() && collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) { 
            // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
          }
```
