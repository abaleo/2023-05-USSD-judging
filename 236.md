# DoS by minting max amount

## Summary

An attacker can mint the max amount of USSD token to prevent any user or the rebalancer from minting new tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [USSD.sol:204-206](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-206) the `mintRebalancer` function is public and not protected by an modifier. Therefore anyone can call it and mint an arbitrary amount of USSD tokens to the contract itself.
An attacker can exploit this, by minting the max amount (uint256 max) of USSD to the contract. This will result in a Denial of Service for the contract as no user can mint any new USSD tokens, for `DAI`, as well as no rebalancing, that want´s to mint tokens will work.

An attacker can make sure to keep the contract out of function, by frontrunning any transaction valid transaction, that follows a burn. This enusres, that there´s always the max amount minted, and no one can mint new tokens.
## Impact

- User can not use contract as intended (mint `USSD` for depositing `DAI`)
- Rebalancer can not mint new Tokens to sell

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Add `onlyBalancer` modifier to protect the minting function and only allow the Rebalancer contract to call it.
