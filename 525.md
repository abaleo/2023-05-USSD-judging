# Risk of exposure to volatile collateral assets due to initial selling of DAI rebalance function

## Summary

The rebalance function of the USSD contract sells off DAI first, making USSD susceptible to price changes of the more volatile collateral assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

The rebalance function operates in an order where DAI is sold off first, followed by WETH, WBTC, and WBGL. DAI being the most stable among these assets, selling it off first might leave USSD exposed to volatility risks of the other assets. During rebalancing, it iterates over a list of collaterals and sells as much as possible of the first collateral asset in the list (i.e., DAI), before moving on to the next one.

## Impact

This behavior could expose the system to undue risk if the value of the more volatile collateral assets were to drastically decrease. An extreme market event could effectively wipe out the value of the more volatile assets and, because DAI was sold first, the system may not have enough stable assets to maintain its value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this issue, it might be helpful to implement a dynamic selling strategy rather than having a fixed order. For instance, instead of always selling off DAI first, the contract could be modified to sell off the asset that has the least impact on the system's risk profile. Alternatively, the selling strategy could be made more complex, taking into account both the stability and the amount of each collateral asset.
