# `mintForToken()` doesn't call `approve` before safeTransferFrom is used.

## Summary
SafeTransferFrom and transferFrom methods need allowance from owner of erc20 tokens to be used

## Vulnerability Detail
Both SafeTransferFrom and transferFrom functions in the ERC-20 standard require the sender to have an allowance for the ERC-20 tokens they are attempting to transfer.

The safeTransferFrom and transferFrom functions moves amount tokens from sender to recipient using the allowance mechanism. amount is then deducted from the callerâ€™s allowance.

## Impact
Without an allowance, the transfer will fail, and the transaction would be reverted.

```solidity

  151:     function mintForToken(
  152:         address token,
  153:         uint256 tokenAmount,
  154:         address to
  155:     ) public returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
  156:         require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token");
  157:          // ==> @audit doesn't call `approve` before safeTransferFrom is used
  158:         IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
  159:             msg.sender,
  160:             address(this),
  161:             tokenAmount
  162:         );
  163:         stableCoinAmount = calculateMint(token, tokenAmount);
  164:         _mint(to, stableCoinAmount);
  165: 
  166:         emit Mint(msg.sender, to, token, tokenAmount, stableCoinAmount);
  167:     }

Call approve before the safeTransferFrom method attempts to transfer funds
