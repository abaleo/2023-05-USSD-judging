# calculateMint() incorrectly calculates the amount of Stablecoin to be issued.

## Summary

The calculateMint() function used by mintForToken(), which mints a specific amount of stablecoin for a given amount of token deposited, incorrectly calculates the amount of stablecoin to be issued. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The collateral used are all wrapped erc20 tokens (wBTC, wETH, wBGL), which all have 1e18 decimals.
The USSD stablecoin has 1e6 decimals. 

For 1*(1e18) wBTC token valued currently at 27122$, the function should return  27122*(1e6) USSD tokens. However, the amount is further divided by the decimals of the original unwrapped token, which almost always reduces the amount to 0.

Below a small example with wBTC, the original formula returns 0 stablecoins for 1 wBtc
```solidity
contract MathTest {
    uint256 amount = 1 * (10 ** 18); // 1 wBTC 
    uint256 BtcAssetPrice  = 27122;
    uint256 decimals = 6;
    uint256 BTCdecimal = 8;

    function calculateMintBTC() public view returns (uint256 result1, uint256 result2) {

        result1 = (((BtcAssetPrice * amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals) / (10 ** BTCdecimals)); // result = 0
        result2 = (((BtcAssetPrice * amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals)); // result = 27122000000  
        
        return (result1, result2);

    } 
```


## Impact

Depositors will only receive a fraction of the stablecoin that they should receive.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the division by ` (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals())` and the function should correctly calculate the amount of stablecoin to be issued.
