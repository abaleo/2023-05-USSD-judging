# `getPriceUSD()` will return the wrong price when outside of min/max range

## Summary

the return value of `getPriceUSD()` can not represent the true value of the asset and lead to the protocol over minting and destabilizing the protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink aggregators have built in circut breakers that prevent the price of an asset go above or below certain prices. The opens up the possibility for `getPriceUSD()` to return the wrong price and leave the protocol vulnerable to over minting USSD and destabilizing the protocol. This happened during the Luna crash https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/. When `latestRoundData()` is called it request data from the aggregator. The aggregator has a minPrice and a maxPrice. If the price falls below the minPrice instead of reverting it will just return the min price. (if the minPrice of eth was $100, and it fell to $90, the return value will be $100). When this happens users will be able to mint USSD for the deposited value of $100 even though the actual price is $90.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a check to see if the returned price is equal or outside of these bounds. If it is revert.
