# Precision loss error on `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` and `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` functions

## Summary

The DAI balance for `amountToBuy` in `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` is first downscaled by 1e12 on `rebalance()`, and later upscaled again on the mentioned function when averaged with the USSD balance.

Operations should be performed the other way around, by first upscaling, and downscaling at the end.

This leads to a precision loss error of 1e12.

On top of that there are several instances of divisions before multiplications that incur further precision loss errors on both `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()`, and `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The DAI balance is downscaled on the `rebalance` function:

```solidity
    BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
```

To later be upscaled on `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` as the `amountToBuyLeftUSD`.

```solidity
    function BuyUSSDSellCollateral(uint256 amountToBuy) internal {
      CollateralInfo[] memory collateral = IUSSD(USSD).collateralList();
      //uint amountToBuyLeftUSD = amountToBuy * 1e12 * 1e6 / getOwnValuation();
      uint amountToBuyLeftUSD = amountToBuy * 1e12;
```

`USSDamount` could have been upscaled instead, to prevent this error.

## Impact

Unnecesary precision loss error of when performing buy and sell operations during a rebalance.

Rebalance will under-perform due to these errors.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Upscale the USSD balance to use in `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` instead of downscaling the DAI balance.

Refactor the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()`, and `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` to perform multiplications before divisions to prevent further precision loss.
