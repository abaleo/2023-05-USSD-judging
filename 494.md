# When rebalancing slippage and fees are not accounted for

## Summary

When rebalancing in a peg-down recovery, the code does not take into account the fees and the slippage induced by swaps.

## Vulnerability Detail

In a peg down recovery, the USSD and DAI supply of the pool will be compared, because they are supposed to be equal in value 1 DAI = 1 USSD, the difference of those numbers divided by 2 should be the amount of collateral we want to sell to get the equivalent in DAI and then finally swap this amount for USSD before burning it. However this logic does not take into account the fee or the slippage to do the collateral swapping or DAI>USSD swapping.

## Impact

Because those fee are ignored, rebalance might not totally achieved after running the `rebalance()` function.
