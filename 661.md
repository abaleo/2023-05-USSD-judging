# Missing sanity checks on chainlink priceFeeds

## Summary

Missing sanity checks on chainlink priceFeeds 

## Vulnerability Detail

Procotol uses multiple Chainlink priceFeeds for the evaluation of collateral costs and the price of USSD in terms of DAI. However, Chainlink prices don't check for being outdated, this could result in incorrect evaluation during minting USSD or rebalancing.

```solidity 
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```

## Impact

Outdated prices from Chainlink could result in an incorrect evaluation of protocol collaterals and USSD prices, resulting in reserve losses.
