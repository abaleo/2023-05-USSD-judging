# `StableOracleWBTC`'s is using ETH/USD priceFeed, resulting less USSD on minting with WBTC collateral

## Summary

`StableOracleWBTC`'s is using wrong priceFeed, it suppose to use BTC/USD priceFeed, but it's using the ETH/USD. This will result a less USSD amount on minting with WBTC collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `StableOracleWBTC`'s constructor the priceFeed is not using the correct address for BTC/USD, but it is using ETH/USD price feed. This is a simple, yet critical error.

This price oracle will be used to calculate mint on `USSD` contract. 

Since ETH price (currently) is less than BTC, then when a user minting of USSD for BTC, `mintForToken` will call `calculateMint` to get how much amount to mint, but then the `stableCoinAmount` return will be less than it should be since the BTC price is, in this case, equal to ETH (which is less than it should be).

```solidity
File: USSD.sol
170:     function calculateMint(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
171:         uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)].oracle.getPriceUSD();
172:         return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());
173:     }
``` 

## Impact

Wrongly fetch a price will resulting bad calculation for any function which depends on it, resulting a critical failure, either loss of asset or overpriced. In this case, it will resulting loss of asset (get less mint amount of USSD)

```solidity
File: StableOracleWBTC.sol
12: contract StableOracleWBTC is IStableOracle {
13:     AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed;
14: 
15:     constructor() {
16:         priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
17:             0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419
18:         );
19:     }

## Recommendation

Replace it with correct chainlink priceFeed (for BTC/USD, instead of ETH/USD)
