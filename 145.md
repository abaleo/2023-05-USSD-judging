# Multiple missing & wrong hardcoded addresses in Oracles

## Summary

In the stableOracle contracts, hardcoded addressess are used to get the price in USD of the various collateral wrapped tokens. However, in multiple contracts the addressess are wrong or missing. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `StableOracleDAI.sol` 
- `DAIEthOracle` = the hardcoded address is the wBGL/ETH contract, not DAI/ETH. 
- `ethOracle` = the hardcoded address is blank.

In `StableOracleWBTC.sol`
- `priceFeed' = the aggrator is deployed with the chainlink ETH/USD pricefeed, not the BTC/USD pricefeed.

## Impact

The `getPriceUSD()` function in `StableOracleDAI.sol` will return zero.
The `getPriceUSD()` function in `StableOracleWBTC.sol` will return the price for ETH.

Without correct calculation of the price of the collateral, the critical functions of `mintForToken()` and `rebalance()` cannot work. No user can exchange collateral for the correct amount of stablecoin and the protocol cannot rebalance itself.
