# `USSD::mintRebalancer` and `USSD::burnRebalancer` and callable by anyone

## Summary
`USSD::mintRebalancer` and `USSD::burnRebalancer` and callable by anyone.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `USSD`, `mintRebalancer` is called to mint USSD to the contract and `burnRebalancer` to burn USSD in the contract. Both of these are used by `USSDRebalancer`.

However, neither of them have any access control which can lead to users misusing them to hurt the protocol.

## Impact
This could be used to fill up the `USSD` with all available tokens, i.e. mint `type(uint256).max - totalSupply`. That would stop anyone from minting any more `USSD` until `burnRebalancer` is called.

This could be used in a front run scenario to prevent users from minting or rebalancing from happening (to lower the price).

Or in price manipulation in `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`:

```solidity
File: USSDRebalancer.sol

163:    function SellUSSDBuyCollateral() internal {
164:      uint256 amount = IUSSD(USSD).balanceOf(USSD);
165:      // sell for DAI then swap by DAI routes
166:      uint256 daibought = 0;
167:      if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
168:        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
169:        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount);
170:        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
171:      } else {
            // ...
175:      }
```
`amount` is used to buy DAI. Since this amount can be inflated it can cause the project to buy a lot more DAI than intended.

This can be used for price manipulation as it would buy a whole lot more DAI (and other collaterals) than intended.

## Recommendation
add `onlyBalancer` to both `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer`
