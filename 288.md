# USSD.sol: Division before multiplication incurs unnecessary precision loss in collateral calculation


## Summary

The USSD contract could possibly result in a precision loss during the calculation of collateral tokens. This precision loss can lead to users receiving a lesser amount of tokens than they deserve when minting. The bug is present in the `calculateMint()` function of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `calculateMint()` function is responsible for determining the amount of stablecoin a user receives for a given amount of collateral token. However, the current implementation suffers from a precision loss issue. In Solidity, performing division before multiplication can lead to loss of precision due to integer division truncation. This means that the fractional part of the result is truncated, leading to inaccurate calculations.

Take a look at the [calculateMint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L169-L173) function

```solidity
function calculateMint(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
    uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)].oracle.getPriceUSD();
    return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());
}
```

The incorrect sequence of operations `(assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18)` leads to the precision loss issue. It is crucial to perform multiplication before division to maintain precision in Solidity.

## Impact

The precision loss bug in the collateral calculation can result in users receiving a lesser amount of tokens than they deserve when minting. This issue can lead to financial losses for users and a lack of trust in the collateral management system of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `calculateMint()` function to perform multiplication before division. This can be achieved by rearranging the calculation as follows:

```solidity
function calculateMint(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
    uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)].oracle.getPriceUSD();
    stableCoinAmount = (assetPrice * _amount * (10 ** decimals())) / (1e18 * (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals()));
    return stableCoinAmount;
}
```

By performing multiplication before division, the precision loss issue can be avoided, ensuring accurate token minting.
