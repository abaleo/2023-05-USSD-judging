# The `Chainlink` price feed's input is not validated and `latestRoundData()` has no check for round completeness.

# The `Chainlink` price feed's input is not validated and `latestRoundData()` has no check for round completeness.
## Summary
No check for round completeness or the returned `timestamp` could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated prices. The functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, which sometimes can lead to fund loss.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue occurs in the following contracts respectively.
`contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol`

 ```solidity
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
    //@audit no check for `latestRoundData` if it's zero or a negative number.
   //@audit no check for `latestRoundData` for the returned timestamp.
        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
 ```
 
 
as seen in the code above the returned `timestamp` is not checked, and there is no check for round completeness.

According to `Chainlink's` documentation, this function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0 or outdated round data. The external `Chainlink oracle`, which provides index price information to the system, introduces risk inherent to any dependency on third-party data sources. For example, the `oracle` could fall behind or otherwise fail to be maintained, resulting in outdated data being fed to the index price calculations. `Oracle` reliance has historically resulted in crippled on-chain systems, and complications that lead to these outcomes can arise from things as simple as network congestion.

## Impact
> Impact ~ **High.**

> Likelihood ~ **Medium**
If there is a problem with chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. `chainlink` nodes abandon the `oracle`, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if `oracles`are unable to submit no new round is started).

This could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated prices.

As a result, the functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, which sometimes can lead to fund loss. The impacts vary and depend on the specific situations.

## Tool used

`Manual Review`

## Recommendation
`Validate` data feed for round `completeness:`

Instance of `Validation`
```diff   
       - (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
       + (, int256 exchangeRate, , uint256 updatedAt , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
       + if(price <= 0) revert ZeroExchangeRate.
       + if(if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - 60 * 60 /* 1 hour */) {
       +   pause();
       +}
        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```
