# Potentially incorrect accounting on the DAItosell variable

## Summary

The contract assumes that the base asset will always be the first one on the `collaterals` array. In the case this assumption gets broken it will lead to an incorrect re-balancing during a peg-down recovery event.

## Vulnerability Detail

When selling the collateral on the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` function, if the collateral is the `baseAsset` then a swap is not needed, that is the else branch of the following code:

```solidity
if (collateral[i].pathsell.length > 0) {
   uint256 amountBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
  uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
   IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, amountToSellUnits);
   amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
   DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
} 
else {        
  // no need to swap DAI
  DAItosell = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * amountToBuyLeftUSD / collateralval;
}
```

The code updates the `DAItosell` with a `=` instead of a `+=` which assumes that the base asset will always be the first one in the priority order of the collaterals when selling (which is not enforced on the code). In the case the base asset is not the first one in the array, then it will override the previous summation of `DAItosell`.

## Impact

An incorrect re-balancing during a peg-down recovery event because a wrong computation of the `DAItosell` variable.
