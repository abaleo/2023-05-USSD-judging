# USSD.sol: `addCollateral()` lacks a duplicate collateral check

## Summary

The `addCollateral()` lacks a check to ensure that the addition of duplicate collaterals does not go through when `index > = collateral.length` This issue can lead to undesired behavior and manipulation of the collateral system.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `addCollateral` function allows the addition of new collaterals to the `collateral` array when `index > = collateral.length` without checking if a collateral with the same address /info already exists. This could result in duplicate collateral entries, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or manipulation of the collateral system.

Take a look at [addCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L84-L108)

```solidity
    function addCollateral(
        address _address,
        address _oracle,
        bool _mint,
        bool _redeem,
        uint256[] calldata _ratios,
        bytes memory _pathbuy,
        bytes memory _pathsell,
        uint256 index
    ) public onlyControl {
        CollateralInfo memory newCollateral = CollateralInfo({
            token: _address,
            mint: _mint,
            redeem: _redeem,
            oracle: IStableOracle(_oracle),
            pathbuy: _pathbuy,
            pathsell: _pathsell,
            ratios: _ratios
        });
        if (index < collateral.length) {
            collateral[index] = newCollateral; // for editing
        } else {
            collateral.push(newCollateral); // for adding new collateral
        }
    }
```

As seen if the index provided is more than collateral.length the said collateral is pushed into the array without checking if it already exists

## Impact

Duplicated collaterals would lead to inconsistent behavior within the collateral management system, affecting the stability and reliability of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement duplicate collateral checks: Before adding a new collateral in the `addCollateral` function, iterate over the `collateral` array to verify if a collateral with the same address already exists. If a duplicate collateral is found, appropriate action should be taken, such as updating the existing collateral instead of adding a new one.
