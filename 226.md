# The protocol can't rebalance because `USSD::UniV3SwapInput()` will revert as it is missing the `deadline` when creating the `ExactInputParams` for the swap

## Summary

`USSD::UniV3SwapInput()` defines an `ExactInputParams` object, but it required a `deadline` as part of its struct interface. This call will always revert, preventing any swaps during rebalance.

This leads to protocol insolvency, as it is still possible to mint USSD tokens, but not rebalance the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

`USSD::UniV3SwapInput()` has commented the `deadline` parameter:

```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp, // @audit
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```

But this attribute is mandatory for the `ExactInputParams` struct:

```solidity
    struct ExactInputParams {
        bytes path;
        address recipient;
        uint256 deadline;
        uint256 amountIn;
        uint256 amountOutMinimum;
    }
```

This is used for the `exactInput()` function called on the `USSD` contract via `uniRouter.exactInput(params);`:

```solidity
    function exactInput(ExactInputParams calldata params) external payable returns (uint256 amountOut);
```

As the struct does not respect its interface, the function will always revert, and so any call to `USSDRebalancer::rebalance()`.

The `USSD::mintForToken` does not use `UniV3SwapInput()`, so it is still possible to mint USSD tokens.

## Impact

No swaps can be made via `USSD::UniV3SwapInput()` because it will always revert.

This leads to protocol insolvency, as it is still possible to mint USSD tokens, but not rebalance the protocol.

## Recommendation

Add the corresponding `deadline`:

```diff
    IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
        .ExactInputParams({
            path: _path,
            recipient: address(this),
-           //deadline: block.timestamp,
+           deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: _sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: 0
        });
    uniRouter.exactInput(params);
```
