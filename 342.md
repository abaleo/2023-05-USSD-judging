# Swaps are suspectible to Sandwich Attacks

## Summary

There is a swap triggered using the Uniswap Router contract. The `amountOutMinimum` is set to `0`, which disables the Slippage protection and results in the swap being vulnerable to Sandwich Attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [USSD.sol:227-240](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L227-240) the `UniV3SwapInput` function is triggering a swap using the Uniswap Router contract. The `amountOutMinimum` is set to `0`, which disables slippage protection. 
An Attacker can leverage this with a so called `Sandwich Attack`by frontrunning the swap transcation and buy the asset that is being sold in the swap before. This will increase the price   of this asset. DUe to the missing Slippage protection the contract will swap for this higher price. After the swap, the attacker inserts another transaction to sell the bought assets again. The attacker will gain a good profit, based on the sold collateral assets of the USSD contract.

## Impact

Attackers can get profit out of the collateral assets, which are sold on a too high price. This results essentiallz in a loss of the actual collateral funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation

calculate and set the correct value for `minimumAmountOut` when triggering the swap.
