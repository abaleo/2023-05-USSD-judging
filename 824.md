# Cofused OR with AND in `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` leads to reverting

## Summary

In `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`, there's ` if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1())` that always evaluates to true and leads to revert when the function decides to buy DAI for USSD.

## Vulnerability Detail

First, let's notice that if `path` argument passed to `UniswapV3Router.exactInput` is an empty array, then call reverts with `slice_outOfBounds`. I tested this in foundry, and these lines of code in Uniswap are relevant: [1](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/SwapRouter.sol#L30), [2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/SwapRouter.sol#L150), [3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/libraries/Path.sol#L60), [4](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/libraries/Path.sol#L8), [5](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/libraries/BytesLib.sol#L19).

Let's notice that in [this line of code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L199):

`collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()`

always evaluates to true. Each collateral token is different from DAI OR different from USSD. In particular, DAI is different from USSD so the condition is true for DAI, too.

This `if` condition was meant to avoid calling `IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);`with empty `collateral[i].pathbuy` and reverting (which happens for DAI collateral).

So [this code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L199-L201) is reached (and reverts) when there is less DAI collateral in the `USSD` contract than the desired amount derived from the current `collateral[i].ratios[flutter]` and `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` is triggered in `USSDRebalancer.rebalance()`

## Impact

When one of collateral tokens that should be bought on `rebalance()` is DAI, `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` reverts instead.

This leads to depeg (`rebalance` not working correctly) and inability to replenish DAI collaterl through `rebalance()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

Change `collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()` to `collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() && collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()`. 

That is, change OR to AND in this line of code.
