# 2 oralces (wbgl,dai) oracle dont work and revert

## Summary
since these oracles are never got tested, The SimOracle is tested in the js file not the real oracles that will be deployed.
The wbgl and Dai oracle try to call the `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` function, but the contract calls it and it reverts because it dosnt have that function selector `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod`.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The impact is that the oracles that are going to be deployed to mainnet won't work and they will revert causing a switch of the oracle. The main impact is that the protocol code does function as it should, maybe causing 2 collateral tokens not to work when the protocol launchs.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
     staticOracleUniV3 = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e
        );
//next few lines down
     uint256 wbglWethPrice = staticOracleUniV3
            .quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
                1000000000000000000, // 1 Eth
                0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2, // WETH (base token)
                0x2bA64EFB7A4Ec8983E22A49c81fa216AC33f383A, // WBGL (quote token)
                pools, // WBGL/WETH pool uni v3
                600 // period
            );
```
`0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e` this address is wbgl pool(separate issue) and it doesn't have the staticOracleUniV3 interface.
###  poc 
set up the foundry, run it in the main network, and then execute both tests and see it will revert
```solidity
//@audit-issue will revert
   function testDAIPrice() public {
        uint price = DaiOracle.getPriceUSD();
        console.log(price);
    }
    //@audit-issue   will revert
    function testWBGLPrice()public {
        uint price = WBGLOracle.getPriceUSD();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use staticOracle from Uniswap or from another protocol that deployed it, this code only needs, the address to get switched to an address that can execute the `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod()`.
