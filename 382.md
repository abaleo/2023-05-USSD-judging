# Malicious user can trigger rebalance when they want

## Summary

A malicious user with enough fund or with flash loan, can easily trigger the rebalance function executing the logic he wants.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since the ```rebalance()``` function is reading valuation from ```getOwnValuation()``` that read pool price from pool ```slot0``` it is easy for someone with enough fund or with a flash loan to manipulate the getOwnValuation() function by manipulation slot0 value which is the sqrt(token1/token0)

1- User make a big trade in the desired direction in order to change slot0 value and affecting ```      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();```
2- User call rebalance() in rebalancer
3 - Depending the ```ownValuation``` rebalance will either execute ```BuyUSSDSellCollateral``` or ```SellUSSDBuyCollateral```
4- Since there is no slippage protection for trade execute by the rebalancer, the user can also sandwich the protocol.

## Impact
High, protocol can be drained

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider to use a TWAP from uniswap instead of pricing protocol valuation with ```slot0```
