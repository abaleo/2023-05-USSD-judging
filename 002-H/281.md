# Multiple Instances of Precision Loss in the USSDRebalancer Contract

## Summary

The USSDRebalancer contract is designed to perform swaps in order to maintain a 1-to-1 balance between USSD and DAI tokens in the main USSD/DAI Uniswap V3 pool. However, there are instances in the contract where precision loss occurs due to division operations being performed before multiplication operations. This can lead to inaccuracies in the calculation of token amounts and may result in unintended behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

The USSDRebalancer contract contains instances where precision loss occurs during calculations. These precision losses may impact the accuracy of rebalancing operations and could potentially result in incorrect token minting, swapping, or burning.

The precision loss occurs in the following code instances:

1. **rebalance()** function:

   - The division operation

```solidity
((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100
```

results in precision loss due to division before multiplication.

2. **BuyUSSDSellCollateral()** function:

The calculation

```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18
```

introduces precision loss due to division before multiplication.

3. **SellUSSDBuyCollateral()** function:
   similar calculation to that of the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` function

## Impact

The precision loss may lead to inaccurate calculations, potentially causing the following issues:

- Insufficient token minting or burning, resulting in an imbalance between USSD and collateral tokens.
- Incorrect token swapping, leading to undesirable trade executions.
- Incorrect estimation of token prices, affecting rebalancing decisions.

## Code Snippets

Below are the relevant code snippets where precision loss occurs:

```solidity

// rebalance function
function rebalance() override public {
  uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation();
  (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
  if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
    // peg-down recovery
    BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
  } else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
    // mint and buy collateral
    // ...
    IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100);
    // ...
  }
}

// BuyUSSDSellCollateral function
function BuyUSSDSellCollateral(uint256 amountToBuy) internal {
  // ...
  uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address the precision loss issues, it is recommended to rearrange the order of operations in the affected code sections. All division operations should be performed at the end of the calculations, after all multiplication operations have been completed. This will help maintain the desired precision and accuracy in the token amount calculations.
