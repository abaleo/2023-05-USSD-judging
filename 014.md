# Minting exposes users to unlimited slippage

[Lines of Code](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#LL151C1-L168C1)

## Minting exposes users to unlimited slippage.

## Summary
The amount of STABLE minted and received by a user when minting can be manipulated to an unlimited extent by manipulating the reserves of the pool/contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is in the  `USSD ` contract at the  `mintForToken` function.

```solidity
    /// Mint specific AMOUNT OF STABLE by giving token
    function mintForToken(
        address token,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address to
    ) public returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
        require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token");

        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            tokenAmount
        );
        stableCoinAmount = calculateMint(token, tokenAmount);
        _mint(to, stableCoinAmount);

        emit Mint(msg.sender, to, token, tokenAmount, stableCoinAmount);
    }
```
Here a user sends nativeDeposit to the pool and the equivalent amount of STABLE is minted and to be sent to the user. However, the user canâ€™t specify the minimum amount of STABLE that they would accept. A frontrunner can then manipulate the reserves of the pool in order to make foreignAsset appear more valuable than it really is so the user receives STABLEs that are worth much less than what nativeDeposit is worth. This is equivalent to a swap without a slippage limit.

## Impact
> High Impact.

As it will result in a loss of funds, and the cost of this attack is low.

> Likelihood **Medium**.  

As it can happen easily and there are a lot of MEV searchers on the Ethereum main net ready to steal funds.

## Tool used
Manual review.

## Reccomendation.

Add an argument for the minimum amount of STABLE to mint or native asset to receive.
