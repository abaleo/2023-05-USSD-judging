## Summary
The amount of `stablecoins` minted and received by a `user` when minting stablecoins for their collateral, can be decreased to an `unlimited` extent by manipulating the `reserves` of the `pool` leading to  the user getting fewer `stablecoins` than requested
## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is in the  `USSD ` contract at the  `mintForToken` function.

```solidity
    /// Mint specific AMOUNT OF STABLE by giving token
    function mintForToken(
        address token,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address to
    ) public returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
        require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token");
        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            tokenAmount
        );
        stableCoinAmount = calculateMint(token, tokenAmount);
        _mint(to, stableCoinAmount);
        emit Mint(msg.sender, to, token, tokenAmount, stableCoinAmount);
    }
```
There is no `parameter` that allows a `user` to set the `minimum` amount of `stablecoins` they should get after swapping their `collateral` for `stablecoins`, and in a situation like this the `slippage` is set to `zero` by default meaning the `user` can get as low as `zero` amount of `stablecoins` for any amount of `collateral`, which will lead to loss of `funds`.
**POC**
Here a user sends `collateral` to the pool and the equivalent amount of stablecoins are minted and to be sent to the user. However, the user canâ€™t specify the minimum amount of stablecoins that they would accept. A `frontrunner/MEV` can then manipulate the `reserves` of the pool via `FLASHLOANS`  in order to make the `reserves` appear more valuable than it really is so the user receives `stablecoins` that are worth much less than what `collateral` is worth. This scenario is equivalent to a `swap` without a `slippage` limit.

## Impact
The `impact` and the `likelihood` of this attack are `High`, as it will result in a loss of `funds`, and the cost of this attack is `low`.
As it can happen easily and there are a lot of `MEV-searchers` on the `Ethereum main net ready to steal `funds`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an argument for the `minimum` amount of `stablecoins` to `mint` for an equivalent `collateral` to enable the users `secure` themselves against such `attacks`.
