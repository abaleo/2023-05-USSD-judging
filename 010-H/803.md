# Protocol Insolvency: Attacker can drain all Funds by using Flash Loan & get all USSD tokens

## Summary

An Attacker can use a combination of multiple vulnerabilities to:
1.  Get (almost) all USSD tokens for himself
2. Use the Tokens to manipulate the PoolPrice
3. call rebalance, to force the selling of ALL collateral and be put in the pool
4. Use the USSD to buy all the DAI (which comes from the collateral)

## Vulnerability Detail

`getOwnValuation()` in USSDRebalancer uses the UniSwapV3 Poolprice (fetched from `slot0()`) to determine the current USSD/DAI value. This is suspectible to a Price Manipulation, as an Attacker can dump one asset to manipulate the price, and revert the action in the same transaction.
This price is used in the `rebalance()` function to determine if USSD has to be bought or sold with/for collateral. 
As we probably have no chance to get a FlashLoan in USSD, we start with only the possibility to get DAI and Dump them to increase the price of USSD. 
Doing this we can force the `rebalance()` function to mint `(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount) / 2) * 99) / 100` USSD to the `USSD.sol` contract and call the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` function.

Inside `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` the amount of USSD to sell in the Pool is set to the current USSD Balance of the `USSD.sol` contract, probably assuming this will be the amount minted before.
However, the `mintRebalancer(uint256 amount)` function on `USSD.sol` is public and not protected by any modifier. It allows everyone to mint any amount of USSD tokens to the `USSD.sol` contract. 
This results in the ability of an attacker to actually control the balance and  therefore the amount of  `USSD` tokens to be sold.
By doing this we can mint all tokens, up to the total supply to the `USSD.sol` contract and force it to sell it in the pool. 
This will work, as the `amountOutMinimum` parameter inside the `UniV3SwapInput` function is set to `0`, which disables any slippage protection. This will result in USSD being available at an extreme cheap price inside the Uniswap pool.
The attacker can now use some DAI (from the flashloan) to buy (almost) all USSD tokens, up to a point where the USSD price now gets too high. 
The Attacker now owns a huge amount of USSD, and USSD in the pool is trading at a premium. A
Actually it will be set, to the state that `(USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12) / 2`  equals the total collateral Value in USD.
Next the attacker calls `rebalance()`again. This time it will run into the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function, which will sell the collateral of the `USSD.sol` contract (swap to DAI) and will put into the pool. 
The attacker now can swap the USSD for the collateral inside the pool.

Attack Outline:
The following steps are takin in one Transaction:

1. Attacker (A) gets DAI Flashloan
2. A sells some DAI to bring USSD price above the threshold
3. A calls `mintRebalancer` on `USSD` to mint the max amount of USSD token (with `amount = MAX_SUPPLY - TOTAL_SUPPLY - (((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100) `)
4. A calls the `rebalance()` function `USSDRebalancer` which will dump all the minted USSD into the Uniswap Pool
5. A uses DAI to buy USSD at a super discounted price. 
6. A brings Uniswap Pool into desired state, to trigger selling of all collateral (`(USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12) / 2 = TOTAL_COLLATTERAL_VAL_USD`)
7. A calls `rebalance()` on `USSDRebalancer` , which will sell all the collateral, swap it into DAI and put it into the Uniswap Pool.
8. A buys the DAI (former collateral) using the discounted USSD

## Impact

Attacker can get almost all USSD Tokens and drain the funds (collateral) from the USSD Token contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Do not use uniswapV3 Poolprice as price "oracle" in `getOwnValuation()`
- protect `mintRebalancer` function with the `onlyBalancer` modifier.
- Do not use the current Balance of `USSD.sol` as amount to sell, but pass an argument with the expected amount.
- Enable Slippage protection inside `UniV3SwapInput` by calculating and setting `amountOutMinimum`
