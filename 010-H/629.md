# The rebalancing decisions are based on manipulable spot price

## Summary
The rebalance function checks the current price of USSD in DAI by calling the `getOwnValuation` function. Based on this information, it proceeds to either buy USSD and sell collateral or sell USSD and buy collateral in order to rebalance the quote. However, due to the vulnerability in the `getOwnValuation` function, where the spot price is used, the price calculation can be easily manipulated.
## Vulnerability Detail
The rebalance function begins by calling the `getOwnValuation` function, which retrieves the current current price of USSD in DAI. The spot price is obtained by querying uniPool.slot0() and performing calculations based on this value. However, the vulnerability arises due to the fact that this spot price can be easily manipulated by malicious actors.
Based on the spot price obtained from `getOwnValuation`, the rebalance function determines whether the token is undervalued or overvalued.
## Impact
Manipulating the spot price of USSD in DAI can lead to incorrect valuation of USSD. Consequently, the rebalancing decisions based on this manipulated spot price may not accurately reflect the true value of USSD.

```solidity
   /// @dev get price estimation to DAI using pool address and uniswap price
    function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
      if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
      } else {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
        // flip the fraction
        price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
      }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a more secure price calculation mechanism: Instead of relying solely on the spot price obtained from `slot0()`, consider using a more robust and tamper-resistant price calculation method,  a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) approach.
