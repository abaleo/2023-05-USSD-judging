# Protocol is easy to manipulate due to use of slot0

## Summary
`slot0` is vulnerable to manipulation relativly easily. this can lead to unexpected behavior from  `rebalance()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`getOwnValuation()` retrieves `sqrtPriceX96` through `uinPool.slot0`. The issue with this is that `slot0` is the most recent data point and is easy to manipulate. Because it can be manipulated easily attackers can change which path is taken in the `rebalance()` function by manipulating this function an attacker can force it to re balance when it is not actually necessary. Or prevent it from re-balancing when it needs to. 

## Impact
unexpected behavior including preventing a re balance when needed or initiating a re balance when not desired.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Using TWAP as opposed to slot0 is an option that would mitigate price manipulation caused by using slot0
