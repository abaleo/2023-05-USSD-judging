# The `rebalance` function can be exploited to drain ALL the Collateral Assets (in a form of DAI profit)

## Summary
The rebalance function within the `USSDRebalancer.sol` contract performs a rebalancing operation based on the current liquidity of the UniswapV3 Pool for USDD/DAI which can be easily manipulated by an attacker using [Flash Transaction](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/flash-integrations/inheritance-constructors#flash-transactions-overview).

The potential consequences of such manipulation are severe and include:
- Creating a fabricated "depeg" event, resulting in the `USDD.sol` contract to sell all its collateral assets.
- Generating significant profits in DAI for the attacker.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `rebalance` function in the `USSDRebalancer.sol` contract can be called by anyone at any time. Based on the current liquidity of the Uniswap V3 Pool for USDD/DAI, this function performs one of two actions:

- Minting USDD tokens and selling them for DAI (overpeg event).
- Selling collateral assets to buy USDD tokens from the pool (depeg event).

Let's consider a scenario where there are 1,000,000 USDD tokens and 1,000,000 DAI tokens in the liquidity pool. 

The following attack scenario is possible:
- The attacker executes a [Flash Transaction](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/flash-integrations/inheritance-constructors#flash-transactions-overview), requesting 50% of the DAI liquidity from the pool, temporarily altering the liquidity state to 1,000,000 USDD tokens and 500,000 DAI tokens.
- This temporary change in liquidity modifies the price to 1 USDD = 0.5 DAI, creating a good condition for "rebalancing."
- The attacker calls the `rebalance` function in the `USSDRebalancer.sol` contract.
- The `rebalance` function utilizes the `getOwnValuation` and `getSupplyProportion` functions to determine the current liquidity in the pool (1,000,000 USDD and 500,000 DAI).
- The `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function is triggered, with an amount parameter of 250,000 USDD (USDD Liquidity - DAI Liquidity / 2).
- The `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function proceeds to sell collateral tokens until it successfully purchases 250,000 USDD from the liquidity, thereby restoring a 1:1 USDD:DAI ratio. Essentially, it utilizes all collateral tokens to contribute the "missing DAI" to the liquidity.
- The attacker only needs to pay approximately 250,000 DAI tokens (out of the 500,000 taken) to maintain a balanced pool (constant K). The remaining liquidity was provided by the protocol, which sold the collateral assets, purchased USDD from the liquidity, and provided DAI to it.
- As a result, the attacker profits approximately 250,000 DAI, while the protocol suffers losses in terms of its collateral assets.

This attack can be repeated until all the DAI is drained from the liquidity pool, and the protocol exhausts its collateral assets.

## Impact
Generating substantial profits while intentionally undermining the project's stability, leading to the compelled liquidation of all collateral assets by the protocol in order to restore stability to the USDD token.

## Recommendation
- Utilize the Uniswap V3 TWAP oracle for price determination and pool liquidity assessment, as relying solely on current liquidity in a specific state may be susceptible to manipulation through flash transactions.
