# USSDRebalancer.sol: Price Manipulation Vulnerability


## Summary

The USSDRebalancer contract is vulnerable to price manipulation due to its reliance on the `slot0` function of the UniswapV3Pool contract for price estimation. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the price of the USSD token and perform malicious actions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `getOwnValuation` function in the USSDRebalancer contract retrieves the current price of the USSD token by calling the `slot0` function of the `uniPool` Uniswap V3 pool contract. However, using `slot0` to determine the token price makes the contract susceptible to price manipulation attacks.

```solidity
    /// @dev get price estimation to DAI using pool address and uniswap price
function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
  (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) = uniPool.slot0();
  if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
    price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
  } else {
    price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
    // flip the fraction
    price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
  }
}
```

## Impact

The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the price of the USSD token, potentially leading to unauthorized trades, incorrect valuation calculations, and financial losses for users of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address the vulnerability and mitigate price manipulation risks, it is recommended to implement a time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracle instead of relying on the `slot0` function. The TWAP oracle provides a more robust and tamper-resistant price feed by averaging the token prices over a specific time period. By using a TWAP oracle, the USSDRebalancer contract can obtain a more accurate and resistant price estimation, reducing the risk of price manipulation.

Additionally, it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive security audit of the entire contract codebase to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities or issues that may exist.

Note: The above recommendations provide general guidance for addressing the specific vulnerability mentioned in the bug report. It is essential to consult with security experts and conduct a thorough security assessment to ensure the overall security and reliability of the contract.
