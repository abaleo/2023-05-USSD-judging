# Spot price in `getOwnValuation()` could be manipulated

## Summary

`getOwnValuation()` is using `uniPool.slot0()` to get the spot price `sqrtPriceX96` for valuation, which could be easily manipulated.

## Vulnerability Detail

`sqrtPriceX96` is the spot price in the pool. The malicious user can dump large amount to manipulate this price. Especially for low liquidity pools, the manipulation can be even easier.
```solidity
File: ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol
71:     function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
72:       (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
73:       if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
74:         price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
75:       } else {
76:         price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
77:         // flip the fraction
78:         price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
79:       }
80:     }
```

The result is used in `rebalance()`
```solidity
File: ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol
92:     function rebalance() override public {
93:       uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation();
```

A malicious user can take advantage of the manipulated price, maybe take profit from trading USSD and collaterals in the uniswap pool in control.


## Impact

`getOwnValuation()` could return inaccurate result, and `rebalance()` function relies on this to trade USSD and collaterals. A malicious user could abuse this to influence the `rebalance()` and take profit.

## Recommendation

Use TWAP price in `getOwnValuation()`.
