# protocol uses uniswap spot price when rebalancing

## Summary
When determining if a rebalance is needed `USSDRebalancer` uses the spot price from uniswap.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can call a rebalance when the price of USSD is too high or low. When determining the price, `USSDRebalancer` uses the spot price from uniswap.

This makes it very susceptible to price manipulation since anyone can flashloan a bunch of DAI to manipulate the price of the pool.

## Impact
The price of USSD/DAI can be manipulated to an attackers advantage. Together with that no slippage is used this can potentially drain collateral out of the contract when trading.

## Recommendation
