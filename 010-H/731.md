# getSupplyProportion uses Uniswap V3 pool token balances which can be easily manipulated

## Summary

getSupplyProportion uses Uniswap V3 pool tokens balances which are easily manipulated. The protocol rebalances the USSD/DAI token proportion to 50/50 to rebalance the USSD/DAI price. This works for Uniswap V2 pools but does not work for Uniswap V3 pools.

## Vulnerability Detail

Uniswap V3 has a different liquidity model from Uniswap V2. The token balances do not control the price. The attacker can manipulate the token proportion without affecting the token price with Uniswap V3 concentrated liquidity.

## Impact

The attacker can control the swap token amount during rebalance to steal the protocol.
