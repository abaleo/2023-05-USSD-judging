# `rebalance()` is using the spot price to perform rebalancing logic making it subject to flashloan attacks

## Summary

The `rebalance()` function is calling `getOwnValuation()` which is returning the spot price of the pool. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`getOwnValuation()` is computing the price from the `sqrtPriceX96` value of the pool which is then used for accounting in the rebalancing logic.

## Impact

Price could be manipulated using a flashloan attack affecting the rebalancing logic and accounting which could lead to potential exploits/loss of funds.

```solidity
function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
  (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
  if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
    price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
  } else {
    price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
    // flip the fraction
    price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
  }
}
```
