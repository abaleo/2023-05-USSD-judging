# Rebalance function can be manipulated by flashloan

## Summary
The rebalance flow is based on the balance token holdings of the main USSD/DAI pool which can be manipulated by flashloan
## Vulnerability Detail
Given a malicious actor
They can manipulate the rebalance function either by flashloaning from the v3 pool or by increasing liquidity as the rebalance checks for the balanceOf the token in the USSD/DAI pool

## Impact
If a rebalance needed it can be manipulated and can be forced to buy all the DAI / USSD in the v3 uni pool causing more depeg.

## Code Snippet
```solidity

/// @dev return pool balances with USSD first
    function getSupplyProportion() public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
      uint256 vol1 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token0()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));
      uint256 vol2 = IERC20Upgradeable(uniPool.token1()).balanceOf(address(uniPool));
      if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        return (vol1, vol2);
      }
      return (vol2, vol1);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You should use some oracle or TWAP for calculating the holdings of the pool, don't use the balanceOf the pool directly as it can manipulated.
