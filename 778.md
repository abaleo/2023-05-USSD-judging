# When removing a collateral the index and proportions of the others collaterals will be misplaced

## Summary
The USSD contract it's holding it's collateral inside an array (list) called _collateral_ , collaterals inside the array are ordered based on their priority, when you are removing a collateral from the list, the index of the collateral will be changed making it's priority to also change.
## Vulnerability Detail
All collaterals are kept inside the [collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L73) array , the collateral have a certain priority, when the function [removeCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L120) is called to remove collateral from the list, the removing it's done by using the collateral index and replacing that collateral index with the last element from the list and then dropping the last element from the list to not have a duplicate, 
e.g : 
1. We have the following list `collateral = [ WET, USDC, DAI, UNI ] `
2. We call the function `removeCollateral(index = 1 `),  the index of the `USDC` token
3. Now the contract will replace the token `USDC` with token `UNI`, and dropping the `UNI` token from last position. 
4. Now the token `USDC` will be removed, however, the `UNI` token will have a higher priority in the collateral list, being on the position index 1 instead of the last position, basically `collateral = [ WET, UNI, DAI`], giving the `UNI` a higher priority then `DAI`
5. The priority list is very important when performing the rebalance() operations as the collaterals are bough or sold in order of their priority

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. After deleting the item from the array, re-organize the array so all the items that come after the deleted item will also move a position back and keep the last element on it's last position.
