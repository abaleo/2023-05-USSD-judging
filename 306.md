# Inactive ethOracle in StableOracleDAI Contract

## Summary

The contract `StableOracleDAI` contains a bug where the `ethOracle` address is set to the zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`). This results in the inability to query the `ethOracle` for the WETH oracle price. As a consequence, the contract fails to retrieve accurate USD prices, leading to incorrect calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerable code snippet is located in the `StableOracleDAI` contract, specifically in the constructor where the `ethOracle` address is assigned:

```solidity
constructor() {
    // ...
    ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000); // TODO: WETH oracle price
}
```

As seen in the `StableOracleDAI` contract, the `ethOracle` address is assigned the value of the zero address in the constructor:

```solidity
ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000); // TODO: WETH oracle price
```

Due to this assignment, the `getPriceUSD()` function, which relies on the `ethOracle` for obtaining the WETH oracle price, always fails. The contract assumes that the `ethOracle` address will provide the necessary price data, but since it is set to the zero address, querying it results in an error and incorrect price calculations.
Take a look at [getPriceUSD():](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#LL33C1-L53C6)

```solidity
   function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
        address[] memory pools = new address[](1);
        pools[0] = 0x60594a405d53811d3BC4766596EFD80fd545A270;
        uint256 DAIWethPrice = DAIEthOracle.quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
            1000000000000000000, // 1 Eth
            0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2, // WETH (base token)
            0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F, // DAI (quote token)
            pools, // DAI/WETH pool uni v3
            600 // period
        );

    // this wouldn't work since ethOracle = 0x0, no?
        uint256 wethPriceUSD = ethOracle.getPriceUSD();

        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD, so multiply by 10 decimals to get 18 decimal fractional
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();

        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
    }
```

## Impact

The bug affects the accuracy of price calculations in the `StableOracleDAI` contract. As the `getPriceUSD()` function attempts to query the inactive `ethOracle` for the WETH oracle price, it always fails, leading to incorrect USD price calculations for the contract. This issue undermines the reliability and functionality of the contract, potentially impacting any operations or applications that rely on accurate price data.

## Tool used

The bug was identified through manual review.

## Recommendation

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to update the `ethOracle` address with the correct address of an active oracle that provides the WETH oracle price. The correct address should be obtained from a reliable and trusted source, ensuring that it can be queried successfully to retrieve accurate price data. By updating the `ethOracle` address, the `getPriceUSD()` function will be able to retrieve the WETH oracle price correctly, resulting in accurate USD price calculations for the contract.
