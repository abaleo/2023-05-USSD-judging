# Oracles getPriceUSD returna stale or incorrect result

## Summary 
In ```StableOracleWBTC.sol```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L21-L26
Also in ```StableOracleWETH.sol``` 
## Vulnerability Detail
In both functions above, we use  priceFeed.latestRoundData(), but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data.

```solidity
   
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
       
        return uint256(price) * 1e10;
    }
``` 
``` uint256 timeStamp``` should be fetched and checked against a constant parameter to require that it isn't stale. 

## Impact
Stale or incorrect results have very severe effects. For example, LUNA has crashed down to $0.00001 but chainlink price still says that LUNA price is $0.01 leads to a big arbitrage opportunity by buying LUNA from market -> supply LUNA -> borrow stable coins out of the pool. 
This could happen to accepted collaterals in the protocol and funds would be drained

## Code Snippet

```solidity

   function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD
        return uint256(price) * 1e10;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function should be updated to check against a particular time interval.
For example
```solidity

   function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , uint256 timeStamp, ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
// 12hours = 12 * 60 *60 = 43200
require(timeStamp <= 43200, "Price is stale")
        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD
        return uint256(price) * 1e10;
    }
```
