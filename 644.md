# Denial of service for the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function when the collateral value for DAI is less than its specified flutter ratio

## Summary

Whenever the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function is called, if the collateral value for DAI is less than its specified flutter ratio, the function will always revert

## Vulnerability Detail

The USSDRebalancer contract has the function `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` which is used to equal out the price of USSD in the USSD/DAI Uniswap pool when USSD has increased in value in relation to DAI. It determines an amount of USSD which should be minted, swapped to DAI, then swapped into the different collateral assets. DAI is swapped to each of the collateral assets if that asset's collateral value is less then its flutter ratio:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++) {
  uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;
  if (collateralval * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[i].ratios[flutter]) {
    if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {
      // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
      IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
    }
  }
}
```
There is an if statement which checks `(collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1())` which is meant to prevent swapping from happening when the collateral is DAI. The logic, however is not done correctly, and DAI will attempted to be swapped anyways. This call will then revert as the `pathbuy` for DAI is empty bytes. As long as the amount of DAI continues to be less than its flutter ratio, this function will continue to revert.

## Impact

Whenever the collateral value of DAI in the USSD contract is less than its set flutter ratio, it will be impossible to call the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` function, resulting in the inability of the protocol to purchase collateral and rebalance the DAI/USSD pool when USSD has increased in value

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The if statement at the bottom of `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` checking for whether the collateral is DAI should be changed to the following:
```solidity
if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() && collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {
  // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
  IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
}
```
