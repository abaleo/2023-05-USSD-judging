# Missing access control in mint/burn

## Summary

Missing access control in USSD.sol:`mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions. Anyone can mint/burn USSD, which changes the totalSupply, changing the collateral factor. This can also be used to sell infinite amounts of ussd during the rebalance process, crashing the price.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the contract `USSD.sol`, the functions `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` are missing access control checks.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-L210

Thus any user can mint to or burn from the USSD contract. Minting and burning mechanisms also change the `totalSupply()` value. This value is used in two places as shown below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L193

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#LL188C68-L188C75

Thus both the collateral factor calculated in instance 1 and the `ownvalue` calculated in instance 2 can be heavily manipulated by any external user. This can also be used to crash the price of the USSD token and profit the attacker. This is because when the price is above peg, on calling `rebalance`, the rebalancer mints itself some tokens and then sells them on the market.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L163-L175

But the selling mechanism actually sells ALL the USSD tokens in the contract. Thus any USSD tokens minted to the contract by an external user will also be sold. Since there are no limits to how many tokens can be minted, any external user can mint trillions of tokens and sell them, crashing the price of USSD entirely. The user can also provided one sided liquidity on uniswap V3 to profit off the attack.

The profitable attack can be carried out in the following steps:

1. Attacker calls `mintRebalancer` to mint the USSD contract a large number of tokens.
2. Attacker takes a flashloan and manipulates the price of USSD such that it is above peg.
3. Attacker provides one sided liquidity (DAI only) on uniswap V3 at a price below the peg price.
4. Attacker calls `rebalance` on the USSD contract, which sells ALL tokens in the contract, even the ones minted by the attacker. This pushes the price of USSD below the peg price and the attacker profits off the provided liquidity.
5. Attacker calls `rebalance` again. Since the price is below peg, the collaterals are sold to pull back the price and the attacker profits again from the provided liquidity.

## Impact

Infinite minting of USSD, crashing of USSD price to 0, attackers stealing all assets through arbitrage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the modifier `onlyBalancer` on the mint and burn functions.
