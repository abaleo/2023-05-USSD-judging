# High - approve() function can be front-run resulting in token theft

## Summary

https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol?plain=1#L242

The approve() function has a known race condition that can lead to token theft. If a user calls the approve function a second time on a spender that was already allowed, the spender can front-run the transaction and call transferFrom() to transfer the previous value and still receive the authorization to transfer the new value.   

## Vulnerability Detail

Due to a known race condition, token theft is possible via front-running.

## Impact

High - Spender can front-run transactions
