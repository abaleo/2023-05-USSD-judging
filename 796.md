# Incorrect decimals for `price` in `StableOracleDAI.getPriceUSD()`

## Summary
In `StableOracleDAI`, `price` is treated in computations as if it was 8 decimals, while it is in 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

`StableOracleDAI.getPriceUSD()` takes the average of the UniV3 WETH-DAI TWAP price and the DAI/ETH Chainlink oracle price:

```solidity
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```
Since DAI/ETH feed is in 18 decimals, the multiplication by `1e10` is incorrect.

## Impact
DAI price used is incorrect, causing amounts minted with DAI to be incorrect.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove multiplication of `price` by 1e10.

```diff
        ...
-           ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
+           ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price)) / 2);
        ...
