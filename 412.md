# An attacker can profit at the system's expense

## Summary
An attacker is able to trick the system into using more USSD than it's meant to when rebalancing and selling USSD for DAI, buy cheap USSD, trigger `rebalance()` again and dump the USSD for DAI, which the protocol obtained from its collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
Because USSDRebalancer.sol#getOwnValuation() uses `sqrtPriceX96` to calculate the USSD/DAI price, it's subject to manipulation when funds are traded into the pool.
An attacker is thus able to trade the pool in whichever direction and cause a `rebalance()` call to take one of its 2 intended actions.
An issue arises when `rebalance()` takes the  `ownval > 1e6 + threshold` branch, in which it mints USSD and sells them for DAI. 
Under normal circumstances, the Rebalancer mints `((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount) / 2) * 99 / 100` amount of USSD and within `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` it sells `amount = IUSSD(USSD).balanceOf(USSD);` USSD into the pool. Becuase USSD.sol#mintRebalancer() has no access control, anyone can call it to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens to USSD.sol.
Putting these 2 together means that anyone can make USSDRebalancer.sol sell more USSD than it should. 
Notice also that, because USSD.sol#UniV3SwapInput() trades into the Uniswap Pool with `amountOutMinimum = 0`, there's effectively no check against the trade's slippage, meaning that USSDRebalancer.sol will take trades at any price.

Following is a PoC of how an attacker can profit from this attack:

0. Assume the USSD<>DAI pool holds 100 USSD and 100 DAI, an attacker holds 10 DAI and the USSDRebalancer has 0 USSD.
1. The attacker trades 5 DAI into the pool, obtaining 4 USSD in exchange. [Pool: 105 DAI, 96 USSD - Attacker: 5 DAI, 4 USSD, Rebalancer: 0 USSD]
2. The attacker calls `USSD.sol#mintRebalancer(10_000)` [Pool: 105 DAI, 96 USSD - Attacker: 5 DAI, 4 USSD, Rebalancer: 10_000 USSD]
3. The attacker then calls `USSDRebalancer.sol#rebalance()`, which will trade >10_000 USSD into the pool, effectively nearly draining it of its DAI [Pool: 1 DAI, 10_096 USSD - Attacker: 5 DAI, 4 USSD, Rebalancer: 0 USSD]
4. Now that DAI is expensive w.r.t. USSD, the attacker trades his 5 DAI into the pool, obtaining a large amount of USSD and leaving the pool in a state where it can still be rebalanced by selling collateral and buying USSD. [Pool: 6 DAI, 1953 USSD - Attacker: 0 DAI, 8417 USSD, Rebalancer: 0 USSD]
5. The attacker calls `USSDRebalancer.sol#rebalance()` once more, in order to make the protocol sell its collateral and by USSD up to nearly parity against DAI [Pool: 1000 DAI, 1000 USSD - Attacker: 0 DAI, 8417 USSD, Rebalancer: 0 USSD]
6. The attacker can now sell his USSD for DAI.

## Impact
Theft of collateral

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Change USSDRebalancer.sol#getOwnValuation() to use the pool's TWAP instead of `sqrtPriceX96`
2. Add the correct access control to USSD.sol#mintRebalancer() and USSD.sol#burnRebalancer()
3. Add slippage control to USSD.sol#UniV3SwapInput()
