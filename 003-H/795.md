# `price` is DAI/ETH instead of ETH/DAI in `StableOracleDAI.getPriceUSD()`

## Summary
In `StableOracleDAI`, `price` is supposed to be the price of ETH in DAI, but is the price of DAI in ETH instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

`StableOracleDAI.getPriceUSD()` takes the average of the UniV3 WETH-DAI TWAP price and the DAI/ETH Chainlink oracle price.

`DAIWethPrice` is the amount of DAI corresponding to 1 ETH, while `price` is the amount of ETH in 1 DAI. The average in:
```solidity
        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```
is incorrect as `price` is much smaller than it should be. 

When an user calls `USSD.mintForToken()` using DAI, he will obtain an incorrect amount of USSD.

## Impact
DAI price used is incorrect, causing amounts minted with DAI to be incorrect.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Compute the ETH/DAI price from the DAI/ETH chainlink feed.

```diff
        ...
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
+       price = 1e36 / uint256(price)
        ...
```
