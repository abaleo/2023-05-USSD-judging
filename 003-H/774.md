# Incorrect Calculation of Return Value in StableOracleDAI's getPriceUSD Function

## Summary
The `getPriceUSD` function in the `StableOracleDAI` contract contains a vulnerability in the calculation of its return value, resulting in an incorrect result being returned. The intended logic of the `getPriceUSD` function is to calculate the USD value of the DAI token. However, the current implementation uses an incorrect formula, leading to the return of an erroneous value. This incorrect value is then utilized in crucial functionalities such as USSD minting and rebalancing, which can disrupt the overall integrity of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from an erroneous calculation in the return value logic of the `getPriceUSD` function in the `StableOracleDAI` contract. The function aims to calculate the `DAI/USD` price using the `WETH/USD` price and the `DAI/ETH` price. The correct formula should be `(WETH/USD price) / (ETH/DAI price)` to obtain the `DAI/USD` price. 

However, the current implementation uses `(WETH/USD price) / (DAI/ETH price)`, resulting in the calculation `(WETH * ETH) / (USD * DAI)`. 
```solidity
        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```
This value is not representative of the USD price of DAI and has significant implications since it is used in USSD minting, rebalancing, and other protocol functionalities.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it results in an incorrect evaluation of the USD price of DAI. Since the incorrect value is utilized in various critical functionalities of the protocol, it can lead to substantial disruptions. The misinterpreted `DAI/USD` price affects USSD minting, rebalancing decisions, collateral calculations, and overall pricing mechanisms. This can lead to inaccurate financial transactions, imbalanced portfolios, and erode user trust in the protocol's reliability.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is crucial to rectify the calculation of the return value in the `getPriceUSD` function in the `StableOracleDAI` contract. The formula `(WETH/USD price) / (DAI/ETH price)` should be replaced with the correct formula `(WETH/USD price) / (ETH/DAI price)` to obtain an accurate evaluation of the `DAI/USD` price.
