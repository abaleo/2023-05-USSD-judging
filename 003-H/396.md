# Price of DAI in USD should be obtained directly from Chainlink Oracle instead of calculated to increase accuracy

## Summary

The StableOracleDAI calculates the price of DAI in USD by using the price from WETH Oracle, DAI/ETH priceFeed and DAI/ETH Uniswap Oracle. However, it can use the DAI/USD Chainlink Oracle directly to get a more accurate price.

## Vulnerability Detail

The price of DAI is calculated indirectly from multiple Oracles: WETH Oracle and the average of two DAI/ETH Oracles: TWAP DAI/ETH Uniswap Oracle with an average period of 600s and DAI/ETH Chainlink priceFeed. The average calculation and the use of TWAP Oracle reduce the accuracy of the price.

            return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) / // (eth/usd) / (dai/weth + dai/weight)/2 => (weth/usd * dai/weth)
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);

The protocol should use the DAI/USD Chainlink Oracle directly, as the price is aggregated from multiple sources and it sufficiently prevents price manipulation.

## Impact

The price of DAI in USD is not precise.
