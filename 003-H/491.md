# getPriceUSD() function in StableOracleDAI contract calculates price of WETH with inverted data.

## Summary

One part of the formula:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L50-L52

returns WETH/USD price, and another part USD/WETH price. As a result, it returns incorrect data.

## Vulnerability Detail

I want to start from the point that this line: `uint256 wethPriceUSD = ethOracle.getPriceUSD(); ` always reverts (as it tries to call 0x0 address), so we can't get info from a numerator from our formula.

But the other problem is a denominator.

Let's check the numbers that we got forking the mainnet with console.log.

    Logs:
    DAIWethPrice:
    1815334096585302685954
    priceFeedDAIETH
    550219077097193

So in the denominator here we got: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L52

(1815334096585302685954 + 550219077097193 * 1e10)/2

The price is 1 WETH in Dai plus 1 Dai in Weth.

As I understand the denominator is supposed to be (WETH price + WETH price)/2 to get an average WETH price from 2 Oracles, but in this case it will return an incorrect number.

## Impact

Retrieving prices for WETH from Oracle doesn't work.

## Recommendation

Frankly speaking without normal data from the numerator it's hard to be 100% sure, But regarding the denominator you can change the formula to:

((DAIWethPrice + 1/(uint256(price) * 1e10) )/ 2); 

Or check the way you get data from the Oracles to change the formula in an appropriate way.
