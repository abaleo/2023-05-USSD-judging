# Recipient address is never validated.

## Summary

In the function _uniswapv3input_ ,the recipient address in the _params_ struct is not checked whether it is a address or is capable of receiving the swapped tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The recipient address is a set as address (this) which means it is not checked as to whether it can  receive swapped tokens or is a valid address.

 function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,


## Impact

In the event that the address provided is not capable of receiving swapped tokens or is invalid , the tokens sent to the address maybe permanently lost or get stuck in the contract forever.
