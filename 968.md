# Precision loss in `rebalance()` function

## Summary
There is a precision loss in `rebalance` function which will result in loss of accuracy

## Vulnerability Detail
The precision loss occurs in the line: ((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount) / 2) * 99 / 100. Here's an explanation:

The expression (DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount) calculates the difference between DAIamount divided by 1e12 (to adjust the scale) and USSDamount.

Then, the expression ((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount) / 2) calculates half of the difference.

Finally, the expression ((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount) / 2) * 99 / 100 calculates 99% of the half-difference.

The issue arises from the division by 1e12, which can lead to a loss of precision. this division can result in rounding errors and loss of accuracy.



## Impact
loss of funds and precison

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L92
```solidity
function rebalance() override public {
      uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation();
      (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
      if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
        // peg-down recovery
        BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
      } else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
        // mint and buy collateral
        // never sell too much USSD for DAI so it 'overshoots' (becomes more in quantity than DAI on the pool)
        // otherwise could be arbitraged through mint/redeem
        // the execution difference due to fee should be taken into accounting too
        // take 1% safety margin (estimated as 2 x 0.5% fee)
        IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100); // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
        SellUSSDBuyCollateral();
      }
    }
