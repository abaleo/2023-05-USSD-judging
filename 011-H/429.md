# No slippage protection in `UniV3SwapInput()` can lead to sandwich attacks.

## Summary
No slippage protection in `UniV3SwapInput()` can lead to sandwich attacks. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `UniV3SwapInput()` function is used to swap Collateral/USSD tokens in order rebalance during depeg event. 
Uniswap V3's swap functionality provides minimum amount parameter, in order to protect against sandwich attacks. 
However, in USSD.sol's `UniV3SwapInput()` implementation this parameter - `amountOutMin` is set to zero exposing all `rebalance()` transactions to MEV and sandwich attack.
 
## Impact
Loss of funds due to MEV/Sandwich attacks.

## Recommendation
Provide slippage protection for every swap.
