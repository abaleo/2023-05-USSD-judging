# `UniV3SwapInput` doesn't implement a deadline

## Summary
At heavy traffic, a transaction could take a while.
In order to protect against long-pending transactions and wild swings in prices, a deadline is needed.
Code includes the deadline but has been commented out which means it will not work.
## Vulnerability Detail
e.g.
1. transaction to trade 1 tokenA for 1 tokenB (ratio is 1:1)
2. transaction takes along time
3. when transactions finally goes threw, the ratio is 0.5:1 and less than expected tokens are received
## Impact
Exposed to price swings
