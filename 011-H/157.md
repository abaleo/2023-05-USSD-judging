# USSD.UniV3SwapInput executes swaps without slippage protection

## Summary
In `USSD.UniV3SwapInput ()` swaps are executed through the Uniswap V3 router.The amountOutMinimum value has been set to 0. Without slippage protection, this is vulnerable to sandwich attacks

## Vulnerability Detail
As the code below, the UniV3SwapInput function uses the Uniswap V3 router's exactInput function to perform the swap. However, it does not specify a minimum acceptable amount of the desired token to be received (amountOutMinimum:0). This omission leaves the transaction vulnerable to slippage, as there is no guarantee that the desired output amount will be obtained at the expected price.
```solidity
 function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
To address this issue, it is recommended to incorporate slippage protection by setting a reasonable amountOutMinimum parameter. This ensures that the swap will only be executed if the received output amount meets or exceeds the specified minimum threshold, protecting against adverse price movements during the transaction.


## Impact
Swaps will be sandwiched causing a loss of funds for users you withdraw their rewards.
