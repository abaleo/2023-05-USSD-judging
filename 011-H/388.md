# The swap function is vulnerable to sandwich attacks due to lack of slippage control and deadline

## Summary

In the exact input swap function, the `deadline` and `amountOutMin` parameters are not set. This creates a vulnerability for the swap that allows malicious miners to perform sandwich attacks on the swap transaction and cause the swap to lose value.

## Vulnerability Detail

`amountOutMin` is set to zero, which means there is no slippage limit. The `deadline` is also not set to prevent long-pending transactions and extreme price fluctuations.

        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);

All of the swap transactions in `USSDRebalancer` are exposed to sandwich attacks and high slippage. This leads to losses for the protocol.

In the whitepaper, it is stated that “for protection against flash-loan or liquidity manipulation geometric mean price oracle from Uniswap V3 is used”. However, the TWAP stable oracles are only used to evaluate the 
value of the collateral and the amount in of the swap, not the amount out of the swap transaction.

## Impact

The protocol will suffer losses from the swap transactions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculate the `amountOutMinimum` using the Stable Oracle for each token type. Allow deadline to be set so the transaction will revert if it is long-pending.
