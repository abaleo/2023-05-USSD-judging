# Uniswap trades are not slippage protected

## Summary
USSD contract makes trades on Uniswap via its swap router. The `amountOutMinimum` is set to 0 which means the trade will be successful even if it results in 0 amount of output token. This will lead to heavy sandwiching and frontrunning attacks leading to guaranteed loss making trades for USSD.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`USSD.UniV3SwapInput()`](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L237) creates trade data and calls Uniswap router with `amountOutMinimum` set to 0.
```solidity
IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
.ExactInputParams({
    path: _path,
    recipient: address(this),
    //deadline: block.timestamp,
    amountIn: _sellAmount,
    amountOutMinimum: 0 // <-- problematic value
});
```

## Impact
High. 100% of the Uniswap trades will result in gaining 0 or dust amount of the output token.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
.ExactInputParams({
    path: _path,
    recipient: address(this),
    //deadline: block.timestamp,
    amountIn: _sellAmount,
    amountOutMinimum: 0 // <-- problematic value
});
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Determine a suitable slippage percentage and calculate the minimum amount of output token expected. Set `amountOutMinimum` to that expected amount.
