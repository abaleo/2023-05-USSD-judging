# Need slippage control for rebalance swap

## Summary

The `UniV3SwapInput()` use 0 for amountOutMinimum. Lack of slippage control could result in loss of funds because of sandwich attacks.


## Vulnerability Detail

`amountOutMinimum` is set to 0 when performing the swap, hence no slippage protection for the swap.
```solidity
File: ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol
227:     function UniV3SwapInput(
228:         bytes memory _path,
229:         uint256 _sellAmount
230:     ) public override onlyBalancer {
231:         IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
232:             .ExactInputParams({
233:                 path: _path,
234:                 recipient: address(this),
235:                 //deadline: block.timestamp,
236:                 amountIn: _sellAmount,
237:                 amountOutMinimum: 0
238:             });
239:         uniRouter.exactInput(params);
240:     }
```


## Impact

The contract could be sandwiched causing a loss of funds lose fund in swaps.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add reasonable slippage protection as input for the swap, maybe the value can be adjust according to the market condition.
