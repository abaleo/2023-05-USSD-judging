# USSD Contract Uniswap Trades don't have slippage protection

## Summary

When submiting a trade through the Uniswap Router, an `amountOutMinimum` and a `deadline` arguments can be used. The former says what is the worst trade the sender is willing to accept and the latter says until when the transaction is valid. The `USSD.sol` contract lacks both. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Sandwich attacks are popular among Ethereum AMMs, an example of them is when a large buy from a victim is "sandwiched" by a bot, first buying, then letting the victim transaction to execute and sell after that, making a profit letting the victim to buy at inflated prices. To mitigate this, AMMs allow for a parameter to specify the minimum amount of tokens the trader is willing to accept.

Currently the `USSD.sol` contract uses a 0 on the minimum of tokens, which opens the possibility to carry sandwich attacks on trades made by the contract during re-balancing.  This is made even worse because the contract also lacks the `deadline` parameter, so the trade and the sandwich attack can be executed at any block. 

## Impact

Loss of funds for the `USSD.sol` when executing trades while re-balancing.
