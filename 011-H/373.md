# Lack of slippage protection

## Summary
No slippage protection on `UniV3SwapInput`
## Vulnerability Detail
`UniV3SwapInput` does not protect against slippage.
The `amountOutMinimum` is set to 0 which means the sender is willingly to receive zero amount of asset.
When rebalancing the calls to `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` and `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` could be sandwiched and results in `DAItosell` and `daibought` being zero while the attacker has drain the collateral tokens by sandwiching the swap.
The functions check balanceAfter - balanceBefore to determine the `DAItosell` and `daibought`, this would not revert if the balance remains the same before and after the swap rather it would be zero.
## Impact
Rebalance mechanism vulnerable to sandwich attacks

```solidity

                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);

            DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);

        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought@audit - would not revert if not change or increase by a little as 1 wei
      } else {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calls to `UniV3SwapInput` should be reengineered to pass the `amountOutMinimum` as a parameter.
