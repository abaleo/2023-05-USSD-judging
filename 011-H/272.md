# In UniV3SwapInput: amountOutMinimum is set to 0, this can result significant slippage when swapping

## Summary
In the USSD contract, the function [UniV3SwapInput()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L227)  has the amountOutMinimum set to 0, which could result in a slippage of 100%. Thus, a trade might incur significant slippage, resulting in the protocol receiving fewer tokens in return, leading to losses for the protocol when rebalancing.

Additionally, there is no deadline check in the swap (currently commented out).

## Vulnerability Detail
When swapping using UniSwap V3, the amountOutMinimum parameter is used to protect users against significant slippage, reverting the transaction if the amount received in the swap is less than the amount requested. When setting the amountOutMinimum to zero, the protocol does not protect itself from sandwich attacks and will incur up to 100% slippage during rebalancing.

## Impact
Swaps will be sandwiched causing a loss of funds for the protocol when rebalancing its collateral. UniV3SwapInput() is called in the USSDRebalancer contract when buying and selling collateral.

## Code Snippet

**USSD Contract Swap:**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#LL227C1-L240C1
```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
**USSDRebalancer calling UniV3SwapInput:**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L173
There are many more cases in [SellUSSDBuyCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#LL163C19-L163C19) and [BuyUSSDSellCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#LL109C14-L109C35)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend adding the deadline check and adding slippage control.
