# Missing deadline checks allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed

## Summary
Without a `deadline parameter`, the transaction may sit in the `mempool` and be executed at a much later time potentially resulting in an `unfavorable/Worst price` .
## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is in the  `USSD ` contract at the  `UniV3SwapInput ` function.
   ```solidity
   function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,  // @audit block.timestamp is set to zero by default making the transaction be executed later at more unfavorable time
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                @audit the slippage is set to zero, meaning users can
                accrue a loss by getting zero amount of tokens from the swap
                amountOutMinimum: 0 //@audit no slippage, can receive 0 output tokens
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
In the `UniV3SwapInput` function, the params struct is created with the `deadline` parameter `commented out`. When a rebalancing is called for, the `rebalance` function implements it logic and then calls the  `UniV3SwapInput` function, which performs `swaps` in other to enable the rebalancing of `stablecoin`, however with no `expiration deadline`, this transaction can sit in the `mempool` due to volatile market and high `gas-prices` where `miners` would not include the transaction right away due to low `gas incentives`, and when this is noticed by `MEV` searchers, these `searchers` (via frontrunning & Flashloans) can manipulate the `reserves` of the `Pool` it intends to perform this `swap` on, thereby making the contract get less than what is required for `rebalancing` and also lead to the dis-stability of `stablecoin`, the impact is worst especially where there is also no `slippage parameter`.


## Impact
This could deeply affect the rebalancing of the `USSD` contract.

## Tool used
`Manual Review`
## Recommendation
The most common solution is to include a reasonable `deadline` and `timestamp` as an argument (instead of commenting it out).
and also don't use the `block.timestamp` as the `deadline` as it doesn't prevent this issue,.
