# Protocol Can Experience Large Slippage As amountOutMinimum Is Set To 0

## Summary

The amountOutMinimum is used as a defense mechanism against slippage/frontrunning. That means you enter your trade, some bot notices it in the Ethereum mempool (before it's executed), creates their own trade which gets executed before your trade and their trade makes your trade less profitable for you. 
Setting this variable to a safe amount is recommended so that users don't lose value due to slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `UniV3SwapInput()` function we assign amountOutMinimum here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L237 which is hardcoded to 0.
This is dangerous as , consider we are using rebalance() functionality and it is a peg-down recovery i.e. function used is
BuyUSSDSellCollateral , and the current collateral is a volatile collateral. 
There might be a situation where the collateral loses value or depegs completely and the amount out , would be 0
(or any other little value) and the pool would result in an unbalanced state.

## Impact

There might be a situation where the collateral loses value(ex- market conditions or frontrunning) or depegs completely and the amount out , would be 0
(or any other little value) and the pool would result in an unbalanced state.
