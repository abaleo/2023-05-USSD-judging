# Uniswap 0 deadline

## Summary

An invalid deadline is passed to Uniswap parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail

`UniV3SwapInput` omits the deadline parameter, meaning it will get a default value of 0:
```solidity
   function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```

From Uniswap docs:
"deadline: the unix time after which a swap will fail, to protect against long-pending transactions and wild swings in prices"

In Uniswap v3 code, we can see the deadline is validated as follows:
```solidity
    modifier checkDeadline(uint256 deadline) {
        require(_blockTimestamp() <= deadline, 'Transaction too old');
        _;
    }
```

This means that a deadline with a value of 0 is always < block timestamp, thus the execution will revert.

## Impact

Swapping on the Uniswap router will always revert.

## Recommendation

Pass `block.timestamp` as the deadline.
