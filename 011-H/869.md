# Missing slippage control can lead to loss of funds

## Summary

`USSD#UniV3SwapInput` executes a swap using Uniswap V3, however is missing slippage control, which can lead to a significant loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

When swapping using the `IV3SwapRouter`, the `amountOutMinimum` parameter is used to define the slippage control. If the amount of tokens received is less than this user input value, the transaction will revert, protecting the swapper against slippage. However in the case of `USSD#UniV3SwapInput`, this value is set to `0`, essentially allowing for 100% slippage.

## Impact

If the pool is too illiquid, or a malicious user/MEV bot sandwiches this transaction, it could result in the contract losing a majority of the input `_sellAmount`. With `amountOutMinimum` set to `0`, the worst case is literally losing 100% of the input tokens!

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0 // @audit 100% slippage tolerance = bad
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```

## Recommendation

Use some non-zero value for `amountOutMinimum` to protect against slippage/MEV.
