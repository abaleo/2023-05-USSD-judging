# Absence of expiration time or deadline of executing a Swap transaction.

## Summary

In the function _uniswapv3input_ , the deadline parameter in the _params_ struct  is commented out meaning there is no explicit deadline set for executing the swap.

## Vulnerability Detail

 
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    
AS noticed the deadline parameter is commented  out.

## Impact
By not setting a deadline it means the swap can be executed at any time even if the market conditions change or become unfavorable. this can lead to loss of funds.

## Recommendation
Set an appropriate timestamp or block height as the deadline for executing the swap.
