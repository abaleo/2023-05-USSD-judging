# No expiration deadline in `UniV3SwapInput()`

## Summary
Lack of expiration deadline in **UniV3SwapInput()** may lead to loss of USSD.sol's funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
No expiration deadline may create a potential critical loss of fund vulnerability during `rebalance()` function execution. Especially if there is also no slippage parameter. 
Vulnerability arises due to the fact that the validator can hold the transaction and execute it later on when the condition favors. Also, the transaction can be pending in mempool for a long time and can be executed in a long time after the user submits the transaction.

## Impact
All `rebalance()` transactions are vulnerable to MEV exploits and sandwich attacks leading to significant loss of funds.
