# `USSD`'s `UniV3SwapInput()` executes swaps without slippage and deadline protection

## Summary

The `USSD`'s `UniV3SwapInput()` executes swaps without slippage protection and not defining deadline. For missing slippage protection, will cause a loss of funds caused by sandwich attacks. For missing deadline, it will cause transaction to be reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `USSD`'s `UniV3SwapInput()` is crucial function inside rebalancing process, it will be used for either buy or sell collateral for USSD. However, the current `UniV3SwapInput()` defined with 0 value for `amountOutMinimum` and not defining `deadline`.  

For `deadline`, need to provide with current `block.timestamp` or sensible time buffer. For Slippage however, `amountOutMinimum` need to be calculated outside of the swap transaction. Otherwise, it uses the already modified pool values to calculate the min out value.

## Impact

Because `deadline` is not defined, will use default value 0, and the deadline is checked inside the Uniswap `exactInput()` call, the function will revert :

```solidity
    modifier checkDeadline(uint256 deadline) {
        require(_blockTimestamp() <= deadline, 'Transaction too old');
        _;
    }
```

For `amountOutMinimum` with 0 value, can cause rebalance process vulnerable to sandwich attacks.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Provide the necessary `deadline`, and for `amountOutMinimum`, consider it can be defined by control role for each collateral token.
