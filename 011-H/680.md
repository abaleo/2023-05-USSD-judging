# No slippage control when performing swap in USSD.sol

## Summary
Protocol doesn't set slippage when performs swap in UniswapV3Pool. That opens opportunity for sandwich attacks on protocol, which results in loss of funds

## Vulnerability Detail
Sets amountOutMinimum = 0 when perform swap
```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```

Attack scenario is very basic:
1) Protocol wants to sell WBTC for DAI
2) MEV frontruns tx and buy DAI. Therefore WBTC costs nothing comparing to DAI
3) Protocol sells WBTC, getting near 0 amount of DAI
4) MEV sells bought DAI, cheaply buying protocol's WBTC

Protocol lose money

## Impact
Rebalancer performs disadvantageous trades during rebalancing, which results in loss of funds.
