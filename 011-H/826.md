# No slippage protection

## Summary

When swapping tokens on Uniswap the slippage is hardcoded to 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

When rebalancing the protocol, it swaps the tokens using Uniswap:
```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```

However, this function hardcodes `amountOutMinimum` to 0 meaning any returned value is accepted. This is not a recommended approach because it opens the opportunity for sandwich bots to profit from arbitrage.

## Impact

Public rebalance operations can be exploited by sandwich bots to exploit the lack of slippage protection.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It should utilize a TWAP oracle or something to predict the reasonable amount to receive.
