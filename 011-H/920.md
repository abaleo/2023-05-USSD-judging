# Sandwich attack could result in substantial losses

## Summary
The minimum amount of tokens to be received is not set when swapping tokens.
Therefore, an attacker can launch a sandwich attack on a swap transaction to unfairly reduce the amount of tokens received by the project.
This is a substantial loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `UniV3SwapInput(bytes memory _path, uint256 _sellAmount)` function, `amountOutMinimum` is hard-coded to 0. Therefore, the token received could be zero.
A sandwich attack could result in a significant loss of project assets.
## Impact
Substantial loss of property value
