# Missing deadline and slippage protection on UniV3SwapInput

## Summary

Missing deadline and slippage protection on UniV3SwapInput.

## Vulnerability Detail

`USSD` implies `UniV3SwapInput` function in order to execute swap transactions. However, it lacks deadline and slippage protections that could be used by MEV arbitragers resulting in protocol losses during swaps. 
Using private relayers would not always prevent such attacks, since rebalancing functions are access-free, meaning MEV actors could force execution of it themself before "good" actors.

## Impact

Swap transactions during rebalancing could have losses from MEV manipulations.

## Recommendation

Consider adding deadline and slippage protection to prevent MEV losses.
