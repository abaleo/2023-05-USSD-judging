# Hardcoded slippage protection value (amountOutMinimum) of '0' can result in lost funds

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside uniswap's IV3SwapRouter.sol interface the ```amountOutMinimum``` variable is a configurable safeguard that specifies the minimum number of tokens that the user would be satisfied to receive.  
```solidity
    struct ExactInputParams {
        bytes path;
        address recipient;
        uint256 amountIn;
        uint256 amountOutMinimum;
    }
```
Inside USSD.sol, this value is hardcoded to 0 meaning the contract is willing to accept 0  or greater tokens from the swap.
```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {

        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
## Impact
Users can be sandwich attacked or swap during a block of unexpected volatility and lose substantial funds

## Recommendation
Add a 'amountOutMinimum' parameter to the UniV3SwapInput that allows specification of the min tokens traders are willing to accepts
