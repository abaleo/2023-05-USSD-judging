# The USDD.sol contract incurs losses in both DAI and USDD whenever it executes a UniswapV3 swap

## Summary
The protocol incurs financial losses whenever it executes a swap between DAI and USDD, as it specifies `amountOutMinimum: 0` in the parameters sent to the UniswapRouter's `exactInput` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `UniV3SwapInput` function within the `USDD.sol` contract facilitates swaps between DAI and USDD using the UniswapV3 Router contract through the invocation of the `exactInput` function.

This function accepts various swap parameters, including `amountOutMinimum`, which defines the minimum acceptable quantity of tokens to be received from the swap.

The protocol sets `amountOutMinimum` to 0, which is a very bad practice as it effectively permits receiving zero tokens as a result of the swap.

This approach poses a significant risk, as any user with access to the mempool can monitor transactions, identify a transaction that triggers the USDD.sol contract to perform a swap, and preemptively execute token purchases or sales, causing substantial financial losses for the protocol. This occurs because the protocol is "willing" to receive an extremely small amount of tokens in exchange for the swap.

## Impact
The `USDD.sol` contract incurs losses in both DAI and USDD whenever it executes a UniswapV3 swap.

## Recommendation
Incorporate an appropriate slippage tolerance for the swaps and adjust the value of `amountOutMinimum` accordingly.
