# USSD.sol : Lack of slippage protection for swap to buy collateral by selling the USSD or to buy USSD by selling collateral

## Summary
During rebalance, contracts either sells USSD to buy collateral or sells collateral to by the USSD. 
For above process, it calls uses the uniswap router. There are no slippage protection. This would result in loss of funds during price fluctuation.

## Vulnerability Detail

Rebalancing - refer below link

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L92-L107

To `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` - it calls the UniV3SwapInput by giving the USSD as source and collateral as target. , But we can see there are no slippage protection.

      if (DAItosell > 0) {
        if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token1(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token0())), DAItosell);
        } else {
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), DAItosell);
        }

Similarly we can see this for SellUSSDBuyCollateral as well.

      if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount);
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
      } else {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token1(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token0())), amount);
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought

## Impact

During price fluctuation, this would result in loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add new parameter and use it as minimum required output value during the swapping.
