# THE ABSENCE OF SLIPPAGE CHECKS IN THE EXACTINPUTPARAMS FUNCTION CAN CAUSE A LOSS OF FUNDS DURING THE SWAP.

## Summary

The current implementation of the UniV3SwapInput function provides no parameter for slippage control, making it vulnerable to front-run attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

amountOutMinimum argument is designed to prevent slippage and more importantly, sandwich attacks. The swap is at risk of being front-runed / sandwiched which will result in a loss of funds.
