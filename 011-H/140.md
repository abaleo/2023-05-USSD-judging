# `UniV3SwapInput` execute swaps without slippage protection

## Summary
`UniV3SwapInput` executes swaps without slippage protection. That will cause a loss of funds because of sandwich attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The swap is called with `amountOutMinimum: 0`, meaning that there is no slippage protection. It could result in significant loss when an MEV bots "sandwich" this swap by manipulating the price before this txn and immediately reversing their action after the txn, profiting at the expense of our swap.

```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0 // @audit should be used from input parameter
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```

## Impact
Swaps will be sandwiched causing a loss of funds for users who withdraw their funds.
