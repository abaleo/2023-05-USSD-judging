# The uniRouter used by USSD has no deadline detection, allowing outdated slippage and allow pending transaction to be unexpected executed

## Summary

The uniRouter used by USSD comes from [[this codebase](https://github.com/Uniswap/swap-router-contracts/blob/main/contracts/V3SwapRouter.sol)](https://github.com/Uniswap/swap-router-contracts/blob/main/contracts/V3SwapRouter.sol), and this version has no deadline detection, allowing outdated slippage and allow pending transaction to be unexpected executed.

## Vulnerability Detail

IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams is defined as follows:

```solidity
struct ExactInputParams {
        bytes path;
        address recipient;
        uint256 amountIn;
        uint256 amountOutMinimum;
    }
```

Let's look at this version of `exactInput`:

```solidity
function exactInput(ExactInputParams memory params) external payable override returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        ...
    }
```

it has no deadline check for the transaction when swapping.

## Impact

The pending transaction can be easily sandwiched. The longer the pending period, the greater the uncertainty of the price. Especially in the bull market, the gas is very high, and it is normal for a tx to be pending for a few days. Therefore, it is necessary to set a deadline.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

USSD contract should use [[0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564) as uniRouter, and modify `ExactInputParams` in the `UniV3SwapInput` function. This version of SwapRouter comes from this [[codebase](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/SwapRouter.sol)](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/SwapRouter.sol). ExactInputParams structure is defined as follows:

```solidity
struct ExactInputParams {
        bytes path;
        address recipient;
        uint256 deadline;	//deadline added
        uint256 amountIn;
        uint256 amountOutMinimum;
    }
```
