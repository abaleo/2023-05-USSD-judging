# No slippage parameter and expiration deadline in uniRouter

## Summary
Lack of slippage parameter and proper expiration deadline makes protocol's main functions (```BuyUSSDSellCollateral``` and ```SellUSSDBuyCollateral```) vulnerable to sandwich attacks which cause loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the Whitepaper there is an assumption made that because protocol uses TWAP, short-term fluctuations won't be a big problem.
There are two problems with this thought:
1- TWAP does not guarantee that trades executed based on the average price will be free from slippage. Slippage can still occur because market conditions and liquidity may change during the time period considered for the TWAP calculation.
2 - WBTC and WETH transactions are not using TWAP(can be seen in [StableOracleWETH.sol](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol) and [StableOracleWBTC.sol](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol)  contracts) hence they are completely open to slippage attacks.

Also it's important to put expiration deadline to prevent slippage attacks, if deadline parameter is commented out, that can lead to zero start for deadline parameter which leads to no transaction can occur (Because ```SwapRouter.sol``` in UniswapV3 has a ```checkDeadline``` modifier which checks if ```block.timestamp => deadline``` and otherwise revert ), and if deadline parameter is choosen as ```block.timestamp```, this time combined with no slippage parameter MEV bots can easily sandwich attack transactions.
## Impact
Since the main functions that will be affected by the loss of the fund are the rebalancer functions of the USSD, the value of the USSD will melt over time. 
## Code Snippet
[USSD.sol#L227-L240](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L227-L240)
```solidity
function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use reasonable slippage parameter (```amountOutMinimum``` ) and ```deadline```.
Since TWAP windows are choosen as 600 in ```StableOracleDAI.sol``` and ```StableOracleWBGL.sol```, 600 might be a reasonable choice.
