# Hard-coded slippage may cause loss of protocol funds during a swap event

## Summary
The hard coded value of  amountOutMinimum may cause loss of funds to the protocol in a swap event by the balancer.

## Vulnerability Detail
The hard-code value of amountOutMinimum which is a slippage parameter in the UniV3SwapInput( ) might cause loss of funds to the protocol if an attacker wants to front-run the transaction.

      amountOutMinimum: 0

## Impact
The issue might lead to loss of protocol's tokens during swap in a rebalancing event to balance the protocol's funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The balancer should be able determine the maximum slippage they're willing to take, which can be given as an argument to the UniV3SwapInput( ) function.
