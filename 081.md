# Likely overflow when multiplying in getOwnValuation()

## Summary
Getting the price in getOwnValuation is likely to lead to an overflow and cause the transaction to revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside of `getOwnValuation()` there is an attempt to get the price from `uinpool`. 
`(uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();`
If the token in `unipool` is not `ussd` then it will enter the else block. 
`else {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);`

When price is calculated here there is good chance it will overflow. This is because `sqrtPriceX96` has 96 bits for decimals. 1e18 will take up another 60 bits. Which sums to `((256 - (2*96 ) )-60) = 4`. Meaning there are only 4 bits for non-decimal part of `sqrtPriceX96`.

## Impact

`getOwnValuation()` will revert which will prevent `rebalance()` from executing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider making sure the calculations are performed safely. Potentially converting the sqrtPrice to a 60x18 format and performing arithmetic operations using a library.
