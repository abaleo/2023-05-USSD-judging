# Chainlinkâ€™s latestRoundData Might Return Stale Results

## Summary
In all of the Oracle contracts, the protocol is using Chainlink's latestRoundData, but there is no validation being done to ensure that it is the most recent price, as only the price is being returned. This could lead to stale data and a loss of funds to users minting and the protocol when it is rebalancing. 
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no validation on whether the chainlink prices are the most recent.
## Impact
The price oracles are used throughout the protocol when determining the amount of USSD to mint, and when calculating how much collateral to buy/sell.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding checks to ensure the price is the most recent. 
```solidity
(uint80 roundID ,int256 price,, uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
require(price > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0"); 
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete");
```
