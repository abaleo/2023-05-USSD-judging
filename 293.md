# USSD.sol: Missing Access Control in `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` Functions


## Summary

The contract `USSD` is missing access control in the `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions, allowing any address to call and execute these functions. This poses a security vulnerability as it enables potential manipulation of the rebalancing process and system exploitation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions in the `USSD` contract lack access control, which means that there are no restrictions on who can call and execute these functions. As a result, any address, including malicious actors, can exploit this vulnerability by invoking these functions at advantageous moments, potentially manipulating the rebalancing process to their advantage.

```solidity

function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
    _mint(address(this), amount);
}

function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
    _burn(address(this), amount);
}
```

As seen there are no access controls on both mintRebalancer() & burnRebalancer(), any one can call and can try to tweak this in their favor before for example before executing the collateralFactor() function since the `totalSupply()` has a direct impact on the return,one can call either of mintRebalancer() orburnRebalancer() to game the system

## Impact

Manipulation of the rebalancing process: Unauthorized addresses can call these functions, potentially manipulating the rebalancing mechanism to their advantage.

## Code Snippet

[USSD.sol#L204-L210](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-L210)

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, it is recommended to implement access control in the `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions to restrict their execution to authorized addresses only. You can utilize the OpenZeppelin `AccessControlUpgradeable` contract, which is already imported and inherited by the `USSD` contract.

1. Define a new role constant for the rebalancer, e.g., `REBALANCER_ROLE`, in the `USSD` contract:

```solidity
bytes32 public constant REBALANCER_ROLE = keccak256("REBALANCER");
```

2. Grant the `REBALANCER_ROLE` to the rebalancer contract during initialization or separately:

```solidity
function initialize(string memory name, string memory symbol) public initializer {
    // existing code

    _setupRole(REBALANCER_ROLE, address(rebalancer));
}
```

3. Update the `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions to include the `onlyRole` modifier:

```solidity
function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyRole(REBALANCER_ROLE) {
    _mint(address(this), amount);
}

function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyRole(REBALANCER_ROLE) {
    _burn(address(this), amount);
}
```

By implementing access control, only addresses with the `REBALANCER_ROLE` will be able to call these functions, ensuring the stability and integrity of the rebalancing process.

Note: It is essential to properly configure and manage role assignments to trusted addresses within the system to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access.
