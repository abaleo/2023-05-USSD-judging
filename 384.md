# There is no logic for the USSD to rebalance() itself without external entity

## Summary

USSD can only be rebalanced if external call to the rebalance() function is made.

## Vulnerability Detail

rebalance() function in the current implementation relies on somebody's call and if there is no such call then USSD will not be rebalanced. This can lead to unexpected behavior and create some imbalances. rebalance() function itself is not a very efficient market mechanism because it prevents market from regulating it by itself. 

## Impact

Medium-risk. If there is an imbalance between USSD and DAI that are said in the rebalance() function such as "ownval < 1e6 - threshold" and "ownval > 1e6 + threshold", the protocol will not be rebalanced unless somebody implements this call to rebalance() function. This puts the protocol in a vulnerable position where it depends on external entity to support rebalancing mechanism. And unless this call is implemented, the huge arbitrage opportunities will be opened.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Rebalance() function is public and not used anywhere in the contract so, first, its visibility should be external if this is the case. The solution to the problem mentioned above should be creating new logic where the protocol doesn't depend on external calls and rebalance itself when it's needed. The protocol says that making rebalance() function public is crucial to make the protocol more decentralized but, on the other hand, it leads to such cases where users might not be interested at rebalancing protocol at all.
