# `LatestRoundata` timestamp is not valiated

## Summary
`latestRoundData`Â does not have checks to ensure that the Oracle timestamp is validated. This in turn will likely lead to stale prices in the Oracle return values.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check in the code for the timestamp of the Oracle which can lead to the wrong price 
## Impact
stale price not checked, which will cause wrong calculations for accounting.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
      (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check the `lastTimestamp - timestamp  < n` n = how long the timestamp can be wait/stale
