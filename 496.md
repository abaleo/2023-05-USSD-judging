# Missing second Oracle price sanity check

## Summary

The protocol missing the second Oracle price sanity check

## Vulnerability Detail

When it comes to oracles, having a fallback option is always a good idea to avoid a single point of failure. There are various secondary oracle options to choose from, depending on your preferences and the asset being used.

## Impact

There are some extreme cases where Chainlink might take oracles offline or the oracle may falsely return a zero price. In such cases, the protocol might be at risk of insolvency.
