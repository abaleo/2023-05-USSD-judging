# Incorrect oracle addresses

## Summary

Incorrect oracle addresses

## Vulnerability Detail

Many of the addresses hardcoded into the contract constructors for oracles are incorrect.

In stableOracleDAI.sol, the address being used for the DAIEthOracle is the address for the WBGL/WETH uniswapV3 pool, not for any oracle. In addition, the pool does not have a `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` function. For this reason, `getPrice` will always revert. The same goes for ethOracle, although that's the zero address. Both addresses need to be fixed. As currently coded, getPrice() always reverts and the protocol is nonfunctional.

The same issue exists in StableOracleWBGL.sol. Again, the WBGL/WETH address is being used for the oracle, but it isn't an oracle. There is no `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod` function at this address, so `getPrice` will again always revert.

In StableOracleWBTC.sol, the ETH/USD oracle address is used instead of the WBTC/USD address, so this oracle will return the incorrect price.

## Impact

Calls to oracles will either revert and render the protocol completely nonfunctional, or they'll return prices for the incorrect asset.
