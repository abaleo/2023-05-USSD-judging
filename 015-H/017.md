# Chainlink address for StableOracleWBTC is wrong

## Summary
The chainlink address for StableOracleWBTC is wrong. It is pointing to WETH instead. Looks like a copy paste error.

## Vulnerability Detail
configured a wrong address for the chainlink AggregatorV3Interface.

## Impact
The oracle will return totally wrong prices causing an incorrect calculation of collateral. This will directly impact the rebalance logic of the USSDRebalancer contract.

With this update, the oracle will return BTC/USD prices instead of ETH/USD prices
