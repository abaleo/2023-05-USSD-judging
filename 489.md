# `rebalance()` is vulnerable to front-running attack

## Summary

The rebalancer contract use the `rebalance()` function to rebalance the DAI <> USSD pool.
If there is more USSD than DAI, the protocol proceed to sell all or part of the collaterals (DAI, WETH, WBTC, WBGL) for DAI tokens, and then buy USSD for DAI using the DAI <> USSD pool. Finally it will burn the acquired USSD.

While doing the rebalancing, the smart contract sell WBGL/WBTC/WETH at market price without doing any sanity check on the amount traded. For this reason the method is subject to front-running.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `UniV3SwapInput` of the `USSD.sol` contract is executing the swaps mentioned above. It uses for parameter `amountOutMinimum = 0`. Uniswap V3 documentation warns against using this value ["we are setting to zero, but this is a significant risk in production. For a real deployment, this value should be calculated using our SDK or an onchain price oracle"](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/swaps/single-swaps).

## Impact

Each time `rebalance` is called when `getOwnValuation() < 1e6 - threshold)`, front-running bot can extract some value giving an unfavourable rate.

```solidity
IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
    .ExactInputParams({
        path: _path,
        recipient: address(this),
        //deadline: block.timestamp,
        amountIn: _sellAmount,
        //Amount should be different than 0
        amountOutMinimum: 0
    });
uniRouter.exactInput(params);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A different value than 0 should be used, it could be derived from price oracles.

```diff
IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
    .ExactInputParams({
        path: _path,
        recipient: address(this),
        //deadline: block.timestamp,
        amountIn: _sellAmount,
-        amountOutMinimum: 0,
+        amountOutMinimum: reasonableAmount
    });
uniRouter.exactInput(params);
```
