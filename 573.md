# Error in the calculation of `amountToSellUnits` in `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function

## Summary

An error in the calculation of the amount of collateral to sell `amountToSellUnits` in `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function will lead to swapping the wrong collateral amount for USSD token and thus will cause a wrong rebalancing operation and can potentially lead to the deppeg of the USSD token.

## Vulnerability Detail

Before explaining it should be noted that the values of both `amountToBuyLeftUSD` and `collateralval` are in 1e18 decimals, it can be verified from the code :

```solidity
//  USSDRebalancer#112
uint amountToBuyLeftUSD = amountToBuy * 1e12; // amountToBuy in 1e6 decimals

//  USSDRebalancer#116
uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;
```

The issue occurs when calculating of `amountToSellUnits` in `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function:

```solidity
// USSDRebalancer.sol#L121

uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
```

The formula for calculating the value of `amountToSellUnits` should be :
`amountToSellUnits = (collateralBalance * amountToBuyLeftUSD) / collateralval`

Where : `collateralBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD)`

The actual operation used in the code for calculating the value of `amountToSellUnits` multiplies by a factor of 1e18 to get a better precision, but instead of dividing a single time by 1e18 the code does a double division by 1e18 which will result in a really small amount (close to zero).

The simple mathematical proof is as follow :

`amountToSellUnits = (collateralBalance * amountToBuyLeftUSD) / collateralval`

We multiply and divide by 1e18 for precision :

`amountToSellUnits = collateralBalance * (amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18`

As you can see there is no second division by 1e18.

Because of this error the resultant `amountToSellUnits` will be very small and will not be sufficient to perform the rebalance operation which can potentially lead to the deppeg of the USSD token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Correct the formula used for calculating the value of `amountToSellUnits` in `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function, the second division by 1e18 should be removed :

```solidity
uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18);
```
