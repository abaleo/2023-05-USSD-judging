# There is no slippage protection when swapping tokens

## Summary

There is no `amountOutMinimum` being set when initiating a swap via Uniswap pools. This allows for frontrunning and sandwich attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

When making a swap, Uniswap enables an `amountOutMinimum` parameter to be set. This parameter is used to protect against getting an unusually bad price for a trade due to a front running sandwich or another type of price manipulation. If the amount of tokens received from a swap is less than the `amountOutMinimum` then the transaction will revert.

However the `USSD.UniV3SwapInput` function sets an `amountOutMinimum` of 0. This means that the transaction will never revert due to an unfavorable trade.

```solidity
    IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
        path: _path,
        recipient: address(this),
        //deadline: block.timestamp,
        amountIn: _sellAmount,
        amountOutMinimum: 0
    });
```

There is an attempt to protect against a swap receiving no tokens in the rebalancer, here's an example...

```solidity
    daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
    IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount
    );
    daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
```

However, it is implemented poorly and would not actually revert when `daibought`  is 0 as they say it would.

Regardless, there should be a more significant check that compares the amount of tokens received from the swap to the amount of tokens that should have been received, instead of just checking if the amount of tokens received is greater than 0.

## Impact

Swaps are vulnerable to front running and sandwich attacks, enabling an attacker to steal value.

## Recommendation

Calculate an `amountOutMinimum` using a reliable price oracle. This will help protect against front running and sandwich attacks.
