# Incorrect calculation of collateral selling amount when rebalancing

## Summary
Incorrect calculation of collateral selling amount when rebalancing.

## Vulnerability Detail
If USSD price is lower than DAI, protocol will do rebalancing by selling collateral and buying USSD. The amount of collateral to sell is calculated at [L121](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L121):
```solidity
            uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
```
Let's assume the _amountToBuyLeftUSD_ is 1000u, and the there are 2 WBTC and price is 20000u so collateralval is 40000u, then we can get:
>amountToSellUnits = 2e8 * ((1000e18 * 1e18 / 40000e18) / 1e18) / 1e18
amountToSellUnits = 0

The result is obviously wrong and the correct calculation should be:
>amountToSellUnits = 2e8 * ((1000e18 * 1e18 / 40000e18) / 1e18)
amountToSellUnits = 5000000

## Impact
Rebalancing won't work properly due to incorrect calculation of collateral selling amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please consider to change as below:
```solidity
            uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18);
```
