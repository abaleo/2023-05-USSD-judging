# Revoke router approval

## Summary

It is possible to change the router but not remove the approval from the old router.

## Vulnerability Detail

`USSD` contract can set the router:
```solidity
    function setUniswapRouter(address _router) public onlyControl {
        uniRouter = IV3SwapRouter(_router);
    }
```

Then give the active router unlimited approval of any token:
```solidity
    function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
            address(uniRouter),
            0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        );
    }
```

However, `setUniswapRouter` can also be used to change the router address. In this case, there is no way to remove the approval from the old router.

## Impact

If the router goes malicious, the change to the new router will not help because the old approvals will remain and can be exploited to transfer the tokens on behalf of the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It should be possible to remove the approval from the router that is no longer active.
