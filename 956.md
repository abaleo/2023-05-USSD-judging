# Missing `onlyBalancer` modifier on `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer`

## Summary
Missing `onlyBalancer` modifier on `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` allows anybody to mint or burn tokens to the USSD contract address

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions are intended for use by the USSDRebalancer contract during rebalancing. Minting and burning tokens is a key part of the rebalancing algorithm and allows the contract to buy or sell collateral accordingly

## Impact
Minting tokens to set the balance of the USSD address to the max amount could cause a Denial of Service and prevent rebalancing. Although the methods are public and tokens could be simply burnt again by anyone, rebalancing is a public method intended to be called by users who may not have read the code. Their attempt to rebalance could revert with them not understanding why

## Code Snippet
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204>
```solidity
function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
    _mint(address(this), amount);
}

function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
    _burn(address(this), amount);
}

modifier onlyBalancer() {
    require(msg.sender == address(rebalancer), "bal");
    _;
}
```

## Recommendation
Add `onlyBalancer` modifier to `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer`
