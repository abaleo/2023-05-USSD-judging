# Router gets permanent approval

## Summary

Router approval cannot be lowered/revoked.

## Vulnerability Detail

Thee USSD contract gives the uniswap router infinite approval for all tokens. If the router gets compromised, it will retain all the approval and can drain all the tokens. This was recently the case for the sushiswap attack, where faulty router code allowed hackers to leverage approvals. The Sushi team's recommendation was to immediately revoke all approvals given to the router before users lose all their tokens. This however is not possible in a setup like this, where it is not possible to reduce or remove approvals given to routers.

Can lead to loss of all tokens due to compromised router.
