# No check on stale data in oracles

## Summary
Chainlink's `latestRoundData()`is used but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:

https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds
## Vulnerability Detail
It's possible the chainlink oracle returns stale data which will impact the rebalance function. And due to incorrect prices might lead to buying or selling more USSD/collateral than needed and having a negative impact on the 1-1 price it's aiming to achieve in the USSD/DAI pool.
## Impact
Incorrect rebalance will happen if stale prices are received.
## Code Snippet
[Link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L48)
```solidity
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the `updatedAt`, `timestamp` and `answer` return values and check with a value that the protocol seems reasonable to accept. Adjust accordingly in all oracles used.
Example: 
```solidity
         require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(answer > 0,"Chainlink answer reporting 0");
       //maxDelayTime is a time in ms that the protocol is willing to accept as delay
        require(updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime, "stale price");
```
