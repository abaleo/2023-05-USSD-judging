# Missing modifier

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` are functions used to change the supply of USSD relative to price discrepency between USSD and DAI in the main USSD/DAI pool. They should only be called after checking the USSD/DAI pool health to ensure the two tokens don't have a price descrepency of more than %1. However, due to the missing `onlyBalancer` modifier, anyone is able to artificially inflate or deflate the supply of USSD without the required checks ( eg Threshold ). 
## Impact
Anyone is able to artificially inflate or deflate the supply of USSD without the required checks ( eg Threshold ).
