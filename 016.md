# Wrong DAIEthOracle contract address called in StableOracleDAI Contract.

## Summary
The StableOracleDAI Contact is used whenever User Exchanges his Dai for USDD and Price will be calculated by given amount of Dai and certain factors. But In constructor `DAIEthOracle` variables points to the wrong contract which is `WETH` and `WBGL` Uniswap v3 pool: https://etherscan.io/address/0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e

This causes revert of TX because there is no specific function such as `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod()` to calculate from DAI-ETH Pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Vulnerable Snippet will revert:
```solidity
        DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(
            0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e
        );

        uint256 DAIWethPrice = DAIEthOracle.quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
            1000000000000000000, // 1 Eth
            0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2, // WETH (base token)
            0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F, // DAI (quote token)
            pools, // DAI/WETH pool uni v3
            600 // period
        );
```

## Impact
The Users never able to mint USDD Stable in exchange of DAI Token.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the address in constructor to correct DAIETH Oracle contract address.
