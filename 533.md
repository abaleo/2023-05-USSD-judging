# Public `burnRebalancer` allows users to burn tokens and manipulate totalSupply and collateralization factor

## Summary

The `burnRebalancer` function in the USSD contract, which is marked as public, could be exploited to potentially destabilize the token's collateralization and valuation. This function burns all the USSD tokens stored in the contract and is callable by any actor, not only the contract owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `burnRebalancer` function allows anyone to burn all the USSD tokens stored in the contract. This poses a risk as the user generally doesn't have the ability to burn USSD tokens. Consequently, this function can be utilized to decrease the total supply of USSD tokens, by sending ones USSD tokens to the contract and call the `burnRebalancer` function.

Since the total supply is directly associated with the collateral factor, which in turn is correlated with asset allocation, an actor could exploit this function to render the token prematurely reliant on more volatile collateral assets, increasing its susceptibility to price fluctuations.

## Impact

The vulnerability creates a potential avenue for bad actors to manipulate the total supply of USSD tokens, thereby affecting the collateral factor and asset allocation. This could lead to increased token volatility and potential devaluation, eroding trust in the token and the wider ecosystem.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to add the `onlyBalancer` access modifier to the `burnRebalancer` function.
