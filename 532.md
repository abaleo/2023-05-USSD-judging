# Rebalancing will always revert breaking the protocol

## Summary
DAI is the main collateral using to keep the peg of USSD and when the rebalancer contract wants to buy some USSD using DAI, will check first the current price of DAI. To do that it will call the `StableOracleDAI#getPriceUSD()` function. But it will always revert, making the entire execution revert and making impossible to buy or sell USSD to keep the peg, potentially breaking the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `StableOracleDAI` contract uses several oracles to calculate the average DAI/USD price. In the constructor it initializes the oracles by assigning their addresses. But one of those oracles is using the zero address instead of one valid oracle address:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L30

So when the contract tries to call the function `getPriceUSD()` in that address, it fails and reverts. And since this oracle is used in the `USSDRebalancer#BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` & `USSDRebalancer#SellUSSDBuyCollateral()`  functions, it will make those functions to also revert, making impossible to rebalance the protocol by trading USSD:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L116

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L190

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L197

Since DAI is the main collateral used (as explained in their whitepaper), this issue will always happen, guarantying the protocol to break since it is not able to maintain the USSD peg when necessary.

## Impact
Rebalancing system won't work so essentially the protocol won't be able to keep the token peg, making it useless (since it is intended to be a stablecoin pegged to DAI).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Fix the hardcoded address. Since it will use the ETH oracle also in the project ([this one](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol)), probably the best option is to add a parameter in the constructor to pass the address of the oracle deployed:
```solidity
constructor(IStableOracle _stableETHOracle) {
        // the rest of the code....
        ethOracle = _stableETHOracle;
    }
```
