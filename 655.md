# Wrong address used when deploying `StableOracleWBTC` leads to loss of funds for user when depositing WBTC

## Summary

When deploying `StableOracleWBTC` the address of the WETH chainlink Oracle is used (`0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419`) instead of the BTC/USD oracle (`0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c`)

## Vulnerability Detail

For calculating the amount of USSD to mint when depositing WBTC the price of WETH is used instead of the BTC price

## Impact

When a user deposits WBTC using the function `mintForToken` he will only be able to mint USSD according to the value of WETH. Since he can not withdraw his deposited WBTC for the amount of USSD he received, this results in significant loss of funds for the user.
