# Value returned by Chainlink oracles are never validated

## Summary
All oracles, either directly or indirectly, rely on a Chainlink price feed. The system correctly collects the reported price from such feeds, but fails to validate the returned value, leading to several potential issues.

## Vulnerability Detail
No sanity checks are performed on the values returned by Chainlink's price feeds, which can lead the system to use stale or incorrect prices in cases in which the feeds are down/have a large delay in updating the assets' prices.

## Impact
The system can incorrectly price its collateral, or the value of assets provided by users when minting USSD. Malicious actors are also able to exploit this in order to make a profit at the protocol's expense.

## Code Snippet
[StableOracleDAI.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L46-L52)
[StableOracleWETH.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol#L21-L26)
[StableOracleWBTC.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L21-L26)
[StableOracleWBGL.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBGL.sol#L36) : this oracle uses StableOracleWETH.sol and hence is also affected by this issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add sanity checks before using the value returned by Chainlink oracles, checking at least that `price` is a positive number and that it's been updated within a tolerable timeframe.
For DAI's oracle, also consider implementing a price deviation check.
