# No slippage protection for UniV3SwapInput

## Summary

No slippage protection for UniV3SwapInput

## Vulnerability Detail

- Someone calls `rebalance()`
- This function calls  `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` / `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` , which make swaps with no slippage
- Attackers can observe when this is called, and rebalance the pool with a sandwich attack and earn profit.

For example

Attacker frontruns and devalues USSD by adding DAI to the pool.

Then `rebalance()` will buy DAI with no slippage.

- `if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {` > `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()`

Then after the tx, the attacker could buy back the USSD for profit, since Rebalancer has sold it with no slippage.

## Impact

USSD depeg. Userâ€™s lose their USSD value.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function UniV3SwapInput(
    bytes memory _path,
    uint256 _sellAmount
) public override onlyBalancer {
    IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
        .ExactInputParams({
            path: _path,
            recipient: address(this),
            //deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: _sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: 0
        });
    uniRouter.exactInput(params);
}
```
