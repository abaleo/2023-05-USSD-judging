# No deadline causing old transactions to dis-balance the pool

## Summary
As there is no deadline meaning that transactions can be  executed at any time. This can cause balanced pool to dis-balance because of a `rebalance()` executed later.
## Vulnerability Detail
`rebalance()` is used to re-balance the pool, in a way if the peg ratio drops bellow 99% ( USSD:DAI == 0.99:1 || USSD:DAI == 1:1.01) anyone can call `rebalance()`. The function does a couple of checks and finally calls  `UniV3SwapInput()` with the re-balance params. The main issue is in this [**`UniV3SwapInput()`**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L227-L240) function, because it is missing `deadline` check. If the network has some events and experiences high demand, leading to high gas cost, transactions could sit in the mempool for hours. If the transaction sits for a period of time and in this period the pool stabilizes this re-balance is no longer needed, and in a way this re-balance will dis-balance the pool.
## Impact
Missing `deadline` check can dis-baalnce the pool.
## Code Snippet
```jsx
function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a `deadline` check, here is an example:
```jsx
+     deadline: block.timestamp
```
