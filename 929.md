# `calculateMint` isn't taking `collateralFactor` in Account causing loss of funds for user

## Summary
In `calculateMint` function collateralFactor` is not considered, which can result in a loss of funds for protocol. The function incorrectly calculates the minted amount of stable coins, potentially leading to an imbalance between the supplied collateral and the minted tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose a user supplies `1000 ETH` as collateral and If the calculateMint function does not consider the collateralFactor, the user would mint 1000 new tokens, which may not reflect the appropriate value based on the collateral factor. And protocol  would face loss of Funds.

## Impact
There will be an issue with the 
1.maintenance of peg
2.loss of funds for protocol 
3.mass liquidations 
4.bad debt
5.rebalancing issues.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L170-L173
```solidity
function calculateMint(
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount
    ) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
        uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)]
            .oracle
            .getPriceUSD();
        return
            (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) /
            (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Take `collateralFactor` into consideration and use it in `calculateMint` to calculate the correct amount to tokens that user should receive
