# In the calculation of amountToSellUnits, the scaling of decimal is not properly done.

## Summary
Many tokens in collateral have a decimal of 18, but the decimal of WBTC is 8.
This is not properly taken into account in the calculation of `amountToSellUnits`.
## Vulnerability Detail
`uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;`

This can be abstracted to only calculate the digits in the WBTC calculation as follows.

`1e8 * ((1e18 * 1e18 / 1e18) / 1e18) / 1e18`

The final result is 1e8 / 1e18, which is not an appropriate scale.
## Impact
Incorrect token calculation results.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Scale appropriately according to decimal. However, be careful when swapping.
