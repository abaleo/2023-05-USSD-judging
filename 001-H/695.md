# Function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` would revert all the time when it gets to sell WBTC.

## Summary
Function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` would revert all the time when it gets to sell WBTC which could make the rebalancing process not possible
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` uses the collateral that the `USSD.sol` contract has and sell it to buy some USSD. The collateral that the protocol uses are DAI, WETH, WBTC and WBLG, in this order. DAI , WETH and WBLG have 18 decimals but WBTC has only 8 decimals, and when it gets to calculate the `amountToSellUnits` for WBTC the amount will always be 0, since `amountToBuyLeftUSD` and `collateralval` will be an 1e18 number. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L121 
Since the `balanceOf` WBTC will be an 1e8 number the dividing will get rounded to 0 all the time and passing a 0 value in the `IV3SwapRouter` will revert because of the require statement https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L596-L603
This would make selling WBTC impossible which could compromise the rebalancing process.
## Impact
Medium vulnerability since it only occurs on WBTC

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Take special care with WBTC since it has only 8 decimals and not 18 like the other collaterals.
