# Incorrect `amountToSellUnits` decimals in `USSDRebalance.BuyUSSDSellCollateral()`

## Summary
Incorrect decimals in amount of collateral makes swaps of collateral during rebalancing much smaller than they should be.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `USSDRebalance.BuyUSSDSellCollateral()`, `amountToSellUnits` is computed as follows 

```solidity
            uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
```
Say the collateral has 18 decimals. `amountToBuyLeftUSD` and `collateralval` are both in 18 decimals. Then the amount of decimals of the result will be:

``` 18 + 18 + 18 - 18 - 18 -18 = 0 ```

The result is then fed to `IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput()` which needs an amount in input token decimals, not 0 decimals.

Every amount swapped will be much smaller than it should be so the rebalancing will not effectively rebalance the pool price.

## Impact
Rebalanicing mechanism won't work as expected, making the protocol unable to keep the peg and vulnerable to theft of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `amountToSellUnits` calculation, emove one of the divisions by `1e18`.
```diff
-           uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
+           uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18);
