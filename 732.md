# Lack of input validation on ratios when adding collateral could lead to reverts in `USSDRebalancer::SellUSSDBuyCollateral`

## Summary
The `ratios` member of `USSD::CollateralInfo` is not subject to any input validation when `USSD::addCollateral` is called. In `USSDRebalancer:: SellUSSDBuyCollateral`, these ratios are indexed by the current flutter ratio index but this could result in an index out of bounds error and cause the entire `USSDRebalancer::rebalance` transaction to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `ratios` member of `USSD::CollateralInfo` is not subject to any input validation when `USSD::addCollateral` is called. In `USSDRebalancer:: SellUSSDBuyCollateral`, these ratios are indexed by the current flutter ratio index but this could result in an index out of bounds error and cause the entire `USSDRebalancer::rebalance` transaction to revert.

Given that `USSDRebalancer:: SellUSSDBuyCollateral` first determines a flutter ratio index based on the collateral factor and then loops over all collaterals with `collateral[i].ratios[flutter]`, if `flutterRatios.length` exceeds `ratios.length` for any one single collateral then the entire call will revert and the system cannot rebalance. To resolve this, `flutterRatios` would need to be changed or the problematic collaterals would need to be removed and re-added with updated ratios.

## Impact
The system is prevented from rebalancing until the ratios are no longer problematic.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate input ratios when adding new collateral to ensure they all have the same length, corresponding to that of `flutterRatios`.
