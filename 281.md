# `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` can be called by anyone.

## Summary
The functions `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` can be called by any entity, allowing them to mint or burn any amount of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` should only be called by the `rebalancer` contract, but can be called by any address as there are no checks defined that verify that the function is only called by the `rebalancer` address.

## Impact
Take the case when USSD goes below the 1-dollar mark, collateral is sold and USSD is bought back and burnt for peg-down recovery, a malicious actor could easily mint more USSD and de-peg USSD once again. Also, minting/burning without any check could affect the collateral factor.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The project has defined `onlyBalancer` modifier but does not use it. It is recommended that the project use the modifier for these 2 functions.
