# Users lose their funds when minting

## Summary

When minting a **USSD** token, users can lose their tokens and not receive any **USSD**.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `calculateMint` function calculates the amount of **USSD** tokens that can be minted for the amount of some other token provided by the user. It performs a division by the number of decimals of the provided token, which sometimes leads to incorrect accounting. For example, if the user provides **1e11 DAI Tokens**,  the result of the division will be a very small number, which will be rounded to zero, resulting in no **USSD** minted.

## Impact

A user sends not enough tokens for a mint, for example **1e11 DAI** or less than that, and expects to receive some **USSD** in return. However, he will not get any **USSD**, but still lose his **DAI**.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function calculateMint(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
        uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)].oracle.getPriceUSD();
        return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());
 }
```

## Tool used

Truffle, Ganache, Web3.js

## Recommendation

In the `mintForToken` function, add a check if the amount to be minted would be 0 and if so - **revert**.

For example, something like this: 

```solidity
 if (stableCoinAmount == 0) {
     revert Not_Enough();
 }
```
