# ethOracle.getPriceUSD() would revert in the current implementation

## Summary

In the current contract state , the `ethOracle` is set to zero-address , due to this this call `uint256 wethPriceUSD = ethOracle.getPriceUSD();` would revert and make the function getPriceUSD of the StableOracleDAI useless.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ethOracle` is supposed to be the address of the ETH oracle , but in the current commit it is set to the zero address , eventhough
the team might know about this  , this is something that should be pointed out so that it does not get forgotten.
We assign the 0 address here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L30  , 
Due to which the call at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L44 would always revert.

## Impact

Since the above call reverts , considering DAI is the current collateral , the call here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L170 would revert and due to that the function `mintForToken()` here 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L151 would always revert not enabling us to mint USSD , and since DAI is supposed to be the first collateral , there would never be any USSD minted.
