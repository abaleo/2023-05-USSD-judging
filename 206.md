# Protocol calculations breaking due to wrong hardcoded address

## Summary
The protocol uses different oracles to calculate the current collateral rations, buying proportions... Basically every important function in the protocol relies on correct oracle values.

## Vulnerability Detail
The wBTC oracle has a hardcoded address for the AggregatorV3Interface of BTC/USD in Ethereum that is not correct. The right one is in a comment a few lines higher (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L10) but in the constructor, is is using a wrong one (the one from ETH/USD in Ethereum):

## Impact
Having the wrong price feed in the oracle will make all the calculations using the price of BTC/USD to be wrong breaking the basic logic of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Fix the hardcoded address to the right one (BTC/USD in Ethereum) which is: `0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c` [Source](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/btc-usd)
