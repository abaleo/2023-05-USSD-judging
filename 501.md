#  Chainlink's `latestRoundData` Might Return Stale Results

## Summary 
No check wether the returned data from Chainlink Oracles is stale or not . 

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol uses 4 contracts to get the price of tokens from Chainlink out of which 3 of them are using Chainlink's price feed . 
1. [StableOracleDAI.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol)
2. [StableOracleWBTC.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol)
3. [StableOracleWETH.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol)

The function `getPriceUSD()` is mainly used to query Chainlink's API . The resultant price is then used in the [USSD.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L170-L173) contract to calculate the amount of satblecoin a user should recieve for amount of asset . 
But there is no check wether the price data returned from the Oracle is recent enough so that it can be used in calulating the values. 

There can be several reason where data feed returned data might be stale . For Example - unforseen market event , volatile market conditions , degraded performance of infrastructure, chains, or networks, upstream data providers outage, malicious activities from third parties among others.

Chainlink recommends using their data feeds along with some controls to prevent mismatches with the retrieved data. Along some recommendations, the feed can include circuit breakers (for extreme price events), contract update delays (to ensure that the injected data into the protocol is fresh enough), manual kill-switches (to cease connection in case of found bug or vulnerability in an upstream contract), monitoring (control the deviation of the data) and soak testing (of the price feeds).

The `feed.lastRoundData()` interface parameters [according to Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/docs/price-feeds-api-reference/) are the following:
```solidity
function latestRoundData() external view
    returns (
        uint80 roundId,             //  The round ID.
        int256 answer,              //  The price.
        uint256 startedAt,          //  Timestamp of when the round started.
        uint256 updatedAt,          //  Timestamp of when the round was updated.
        uint80 answeredInRound      //  The round ID of the round in which the answer was computed.
    )
```
Because there is no timestamp tolerance of the updated source time is checked while storing the return parameters as recommend by Chainlink [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds).

This can result in miscalculation of amount of the stablecoin in  [mint logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L170-L173).
 

## Impact
Returned Price of Data Feed has a direct impact in Calculation of StableCoin with the given asset . 2 Cases can occur

Case 1 ( actual price > returned price ) 
It would lead to an overvaluation of the stablecoin. This means that more stablecoins would be minted than necessary, resulting in an inflated supply of stablecoins in circulation. This can result in 

Case 2 ( actual price < returned price ) 
It would lead to an overvaluation of the  stablecoin.

Both the cases open up Arbitrage Oppurtinities and even Destabalization of the Coin . 

Since there is direct loss of funds the impact would be of High Severity . 

## Code Snippet
There are 4 instances where this has occured 
1. [DAI Oracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#LL48C7-L48C7)
2. [WBTC Oracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L23)
3. [WETH Oracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol#L23)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Chainlink Recommends 

>Your application should track the latestTimestamp variable or use the updatedAt value from the latestRoundData() function to make >sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it. If your application detects that the reported answer is not >updated within the heartbeat or within time limits that you determine are acceptable for your application, pause operation or switch >to an alternate operation mode while identifying the cause of the delay.

>During periods of low volatility, the heartbeat triggers updates to the latest answer. Some heartbeats are configured to last several >hours, so your application should check the timestamp and verify that the latest answer is recent enough for your application.


It is recommended both to add also a tolerance that compares the updatedAt return timestamp from latestRoundData() with the current block timestamp and ensure that the priceFeed is being updated with the required frequency.

Additional Validation like this is good 
```solidity 
 (uint80 roundID, int256 _price, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = feed.latestRoundData();
    require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "ChainLink: Stale price");
    require(updatedAt != 0, "ChainLink: Round not complete");
```
