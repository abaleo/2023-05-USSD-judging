# Lack of access control to burnRebalancer(), anyone can burn at any time .

## Summary
Lack of access control to burnRebalancer(), anyone can burn at any time . According to docs the burn should be done "Rebalancing is selling collateral and burning USSD for peg down recovery (supply contraction) " .But no access control to burnRebalancer() leads attacker can intentionally paid gas fee and burn the entire USSD amount .


## Vulnerability Detail
This burnRebalancer() looks like below
```solidity 
    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
In above function which clearly states that burn USSD of address(this) and specified amount which leads to attacker can pay the little gas amount and  burn entire  USSD it is potential loss for protocol and users. In above this function comments looks like below:-
```solidity
    /*//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
                               REBALANCER
    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////*/
```
means functions which comes under this sections only available for rebalancer . They  declare onlyBalancer() modifier but didn't apply for both mintRebalancer() and burnRebalacner() functions leaved as public function. In docs mention rebalance() can call by anyone "The rebalance function is public and could be executed by anyone. This decision was made deliberately â€“ providing less dependency on a single entity or project team supporting the calls for rebalancing." but inside rebalance() function calls 
[BuyUSSDSellCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L97) function and in that calls [burnRebalancer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L160) function . But attacker can call [burnRebalancer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L208) without rebalance() because [burnRebalancer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L208) is public function without any modifier and can drain full amount USSD by paying little amount gas fee .



## Impact
Anyone can make burn of USSD token at any time with intentionally  that's why it is high.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add below modifier to 
```solidity
 modifier onlyBalancer() {
        require(msg.sender == address(rebalancer), "bal");
        _;
    }
```

TO 

```solidity
   function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public  override  onlyBalancer {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
