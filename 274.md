# Previous token approvals are not removed when `uniRouter` is changed

## Summary

In the `USSD` contract, when the Uiniswap router address is updated, old token approvals are not removed. Should an existing router ever become compromised, an attacker could use the old router to drain the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Uniswap router address is set through the `setUniswapRouter` function.

```solidity
    function setUniswapRouter(address _router) public onlyControl {
        uniRouter = IV3SwapRouter(_router);
    }
```

And token approvals are issued through the `approveToRouter` function.

```solidity
    function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
            address(uniRouter), 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        );
    }
```   

## Impact

This means that the router can be updated if needed, such as in a scenario where the router is compromised. However, there is no way to manage existing token approvals. If the router is updated, the old router can still transfer this contract's tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a function, protected by the `onlyControl` modifier, that can be used to revoke token approvals.
