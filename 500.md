# Wrong amount of `USSD` tokens are minted during `Initialization` of the `USSD` contract

[Line of Code](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L42)
## Summary
The amount of `USSD` to be `minted` when the `USSD` contract is `initialized` is not correct, where it mints `10_000` `USSD` tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `documentation/White-Paper` explicitly states that during initialization, `1000 USSD` should be minted against `1000 DAI`, with a price ratio of `1:1`, as the `USSD` is being pegged to the `DAI` Token, but in the `USSD` contract `10_000 USSD` is minted instead, which is against what was stated in the `White-Paper`.
```doc
USSD coin is initialized' with one-time minting of 1000 USSD, taking 1000 DAI as collateral. This 1000 USSD would allow to create a pool USSD/DAI to have initial liquidity. 
```
In The `USSD` contract it implements that plan differently.

```solidity
    function initialize(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol
    ) public initializer {
        __Context_init_unchained();
        __AccessControl_init_unchained();
        __ERC20_init_unchained(name, symbol);

        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _msgSender());

        // mint 10k USSD to create initial pool
        _mint(msg.sender, 10_000 * 1e6);
    }
```
This will cause an imbalance in the planned price making, `1 USSD` token to be worth `0.1 DAI`. which contradicts the whole idea of USSD being a stablecoin.
## Impact
This will lead to an improper balance of tokens in the `USSD/DAI` pool which will alter `prices` when the pool is used for price discovery of the USSD token, where the ratio is supposed to be `1:1`, minting `10_000 USSD` will make the ratio `10:1`.

## Tool used
`Manual Review`
## Recommendation
The proper amount to `mint` should be input into the `_mint` function or adjust the amount of `DAI` to be used as `collateral`.
The Correct `implementation` of the code would be:

```solidity
    function initialize(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol
    ) public initializer {
        __Context_init_unchained();
        __AccessControl_init_unchained();
        __ERC20_init_unchained(name, symbol);

        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _msgSender());

        // mint 1k USSD to create an initial pool
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000 * 1e6);
    }
```
