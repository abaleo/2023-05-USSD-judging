# Poor validation of the chainlink oracle timestamp and round id

## Summary

Poor validation of the chainlink oracle timestamp and round id

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD, so multiply by 10 decimals to get 18 decimal fractional
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```

the timestamp and round id is never validated to make sure the price returned from chainlink is outdated

## Impact

this is not good because if the price becomes stale, the stale price is used to value the asset collateral and can mint wrong amount of USSD,

for example, the ETH price is 2500 USD returned by chainlink oracle, now the market crush and WETH dropped to 1000 USD, if the oracle timestamp is stale, user can still use 2500 ETH / USD price to overmint USSD

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol validate the round completeness and check the timestamp returned from the oracle is within the certain range to make sure the price is fresh
