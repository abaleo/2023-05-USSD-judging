# Lack of incentive for someone to run function `rebalance()`

## Summary
Although `rebalance()` function is public and can be called by anyone. It lacks incentive for someone to call the function except for the protocol team. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The USSD protocol called itself autonomous protocol and it is supposed to exist for quite a long time. Then the incentive should be given to the one who calls `rebalance()` function. Because this is very important to keep the peg of USSD token. Now there is no incentive for someone to call the `rebalance()` function, so in the long term, when the protocol becomes total decentralized, there can be nobody who wants to call and maintain the protocol. 
The reason can be anything like: they have no time or attention, they have no interest or they have no expertise to do it. 

The only incentive people wants to call the function is: the USSD holders need to call it to keep USSD pegging. Or not they can suffer from the loss of funds. 
This also becomes an incentive of not holding USSD anymore, so it is easy to imagine in this kind of situation users will give up holding USSD. 

## Impact
No incentive to keep the peg means the protocol can die in the long term if no one wants to maintain the protocol and run the `rebalance()` function. As a result of this, the protocol cannot call itself truly an "autonomous protocol". 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: USSDRebalancer.sol
093:     function rebalance() override public {
094:       uint256 ownval = getOwnValuation();
095:       (uint256 USSDamount, uint256 DAIamount) = getSupplyProportion();
096:       if (ownval < 1e6 - threshold) {
097:         // peg-down recovery
098:         BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12)/2);
099:       } else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold) {
100:         // mint and buy collateral
101:         // never sell too much USSD for DAI so it 'overshoots' (becomes more in quantity than DAI on the pool)
102:         // otherwise could be arbitraged through mint/redeem
103:         // the execution difference due to fee should be taken into accounting too
104:         // take 1% safety margin (estimated as 2 x 0.5% fee)
105:         IUSSD(USSD).mintRebalancer(((DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount)/2) * 99 / 100); // mint ourselves amount till balance recover
106:         SellUSSDBuyCollateral();
107:       }
108:     }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add some incentive(or reward) for anyone who calls `rebalance()` function when it is necessary to the protocol. 
The incentive mechanism can be designed properly, e.g. you can give the incentive from the liquidity provider's fee which gained from providing liquidity in the Uniswap V3 protocol.
