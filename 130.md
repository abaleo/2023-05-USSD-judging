# Tokens are not approved before calling Router.exactInput

## Summary
Tokens are not approved before calling Router.exactInput

## Vulnerability Detail
To perform a swap, it requires the sender to first approved the input token to router contract. The USSD.sol#UniV3SwapInput function as `msg.sender` makes an external call `uniRouter.exactInput()` and it is supposed to token must be approved before they can be exchanged. 

But current implementation fails to do that, Hence any calls to the router will eventually revert. 

```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```

## Impact
swaps fails due to not given enough allowance.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider approving the exact amount of input tokens before the swap.
