# Liquidity is too low for initial USSD liquidity and for WBGL liquidity

## Summary

Liquidity is too low for initial USSD liquidity and for WBGL liquidity

## Vulnerability Detail

A few issue, first issue, the USSD is supposed to backed the collateral, but when the smart contract address is deployed

10K USSD is minted

```solidity
   function initialize(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol
    ) public initializer {
        __Context_init_unchained();
        __AccessControl_init_unchained();
        __ERC20_init_unchained(name, symbol);

        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _msgSender());

        // mint 10k USSD to create initial pool
        _mint(msg.sender, 10_000 * 1e6);
    }

```

the issue is this 10K USSD is not backed by any collateral

and, given that this is a stablecoin, the price is expected to be 1 USD, then that means only 10K DAI will be paired with 10K USSD in the initial Uniswap V3 pool, the liquidity is just too low to manipulate even without flashloan.

the protocol intended to support WBGL as token as collateral to mint USSD,

https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x982152a6c7f732ec7c9ea998ddd9ebde00dfa16e

However, the total liquidity is too low as well for WBGL token

the total liquidity is just 22K, which is easy to manipulate the price as well.

## Impact

Initial price of USSD is vulnerable to manipulation

Unbacked USSD make the USSD depegged to 1 USD

thin liquidity collateral is vulnerble to price manipulation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol mint more USSD to bootstrap liquidity and make sure the the USSD is backed by the collateral

We recommend the protocol select the collateral carefully and make sure the collateral has enough liquidity, (difficult to identify enough but 22K is not enough)
