# Users can mint 0 USSD in excange for non-zero amount

## Summary

```Users can mint 0 USSD for non zero amount resulting in both users loosing funds and needlessly putting pressure on the `rebalance()` function by recieving token without minting appropriate amount of USSD

## Vulnerability Detail
In `calculateMint()` calculations are performed to determine how much USSD a user should get in exchange for the amount they put in. 
`   /// @dev Return how much STABLECOIN does user receive for AMOUNT of asset
    function calculateMint(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
        uint256 assetPrice = collateral[getCollateralIndex(_token)].oracle.getPriceUSD();
        return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** decimals())) / (10 ** IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(_token).decimals());
    }`

The issue here is that there is no check for zero on the value being returned. In some instances it is possible for a user to deposit a real amount of tokens and get 0 USSD in return 

Below you 
```solidity
    function calculateMint(uint256 _amount /*this would go where the 1e8 is*/) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 assetPrice = 4000e18; // price of eth
        return (((assetPrice * _amount) / 1e18) * (10 ** 6)) / (10 ** 18);
// this will return 0 even though 1e12 
    }    
```
