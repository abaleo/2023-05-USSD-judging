# Rebalance swaps executed from USSD contract, could be sandwiched

## Summary
Since `amountOutMinimum` is passed as 0, for uniswap swap, one can sandwich the swap and extract the value

## Vulnerability Detail
USSD allows rebalance contracts to do swaps for the collateral assets and USSD to control the peg.
However, the swap has amountOutMinimum set as 0 always, allowing someone to sandwich the swap and extract value from the contract's funds.

In the worst case, the contract could get 0 worth of assets for their swap input.
Since rebalance action is permissionless, one can keep doing rebalances and drain all of the contract's funds.

## Impact
Loss of collateral assets when swap is  
- BaseAsset to CollateralAsset (collateral rebalancing inside Sell USSD)
 OR 
- USSD to baseAsset (Sell USSD)

Loss of USSD when swap is
CollateralAsset to USSD  (Buy USSD)

## Recommendation
Consider deriving amountOutMinimum from fetched price and passing it as input for swap
