# Lack of any slippage protection can result in all swaps getting sandwiched

## Summary

All swaps performed by the protocol utilize the `UniV3SwapInput` function which has no slippage protection, meaning all swaps can be sandwiched, leading to loss of funds

## Vulnerability Detail

All swaps performed by the protocol utilize the `UniV3SwapInput` function, which utilizes the `exactInput` function of the Uniswap V3 router. This function takes in a parameters struct specifying the criteria for the swap, which is set as:
```solidity
IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
    .ExactInputParams({
        path: _path,
        recipient: address(this),
        //deadline: block.timestamp,
        amountIn: _sellAmount,
        amountOutMinimum: 0
    });
```
The issue is that `amountOutMinimum` is set to 0, which effectively allows for swaps to be completed with arbitrarily high slippage. Since this function is used for performing swaps across all pools (selling and buying all listed collateral), there are many cases in which the protocol is subject to getting sandwiched and losing a  large portion of their swap. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the core functionality `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` and `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` used to keep the USSD peg are ultimately reliant on getting a small amount of slippage.

## Impact

All swaps performed by the protocol are at risk of being sandwiched, leading to potentially huge losses of funds for the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are two ways to remedy this issue. The first is to allow the caller to specify a reasonable `amountOutMinimum` value for the swaps. The second is to automate this, potentially by calculating `amountOutMinimum` through the use of applying an allowable amount of slippage to the price of the pool based on the Uniswap V3 oracle.
