# Pool price is extemely easy to manipulate

## Summary
USSDRebalancer.getOwnValuation() uses the UniV3Pool.slot0 to get the price of derivative in liquidity pool. UniV3Pool.slot0 is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate.

## Vulnerability Detail
USSDRebalancer.getOwnValuation() uses the UniV3Pool.slot0 to get the price of derivative in liquidity pool. UniV3Pool.slot0 is the most recent data point and can easily be manipulated.
```solidity
  function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
      if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
      } else {
        price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
        // flip the fraction
        price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
      }
    }
```
The `rebalance()` function directly uses the values returned by `getOwnValuation()`. This allows a malicious user to manipulate the valuation of the LP. An example of this kind of manipulation would be to use large buys/sells to alter the composition of the LP to make it worth less or more.
## Impact
The price can be manipulated.
