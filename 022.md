# mintForToken, to address should be checked for Non zero

## Summary
In the mintForToken, as a good project protecting the interest of end user, it will be good to check for Non zero address before performing the transaction. As a public function, the exposure is larger, so implementing a check and reverting incase of zero address will help.

## Vulnerability Detail
mintForToken should check for To address to be non zero before peforming the transfer.  Incase the user passes a zero address, those funds will be lost.

## Impact
Passing of 0 address in "To" address can result in loss of funds.
