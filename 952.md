# Trading on Uniswap is done without slippage protection

## Summary
Trading on Uniswap is done without slippage protection

## Vulnerability Detail
All calls to the Uniswap Router when rebalancing go through `USSD::UniV3SwapInput` which has the `amount0Minimum` argument hardcoded to 0. This allows successful trades which result in little or no tokens in return


## Impact
Loss of collateral due to lack of slippage protection when trading. The peg may be able to remain overcollateralised by the desired ratios due to the oracle mechanism but any excess collateral can be lost due to slippage. This could be triggered by a malicious trader and a call to `USSDRebalancer::rebalance`


## Code Snippet
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L227>
```solidity
function UniV3SwapInput(
    bytes memory _path,
    uint256 _sellAmount
) public override onlyBalancer {
    IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
        .ExactInputParams({
            path: _path,
            recipient: address(this),
            //deadline: block.timestamp,
            amountIn: _sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: 0
        });
    uniRouter.exactInput(params);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the desired amount of tokens to receive and provide it as an argument
