# `quoteAllAvailablePoolsWithTimePeriod` can be manipulated with low liquidity pools

## Summary
`quoteAllAvailablePoolsWithTimePeriod` can be manipulated with low liquidity pools

As we can see WBGL-WETH pool has low liquidity (only total 20 K $ liquidity )
https://etherscan.io/address/0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e


## Vulnerability Detail
Manipulating the price of a token used in a perpetual opens up the opportunity for arbitrage on the this protocol which in turn could increase counterparty risk

The vulnerability arises because the code relies solely on the liquidity and pricing information of a single pool. If the pool has low liquidity, it becomes easier for malicious actors to manipulate the price by executing trades that have a significant impact on the pool price.


## Impact

```js
Our empirical analysis finds that the concentrated liquidity CPMM
pioneered by Uniswap V3 is currently not ready to handle unexpected price drops. 
Not only did we observe significant price inaccuracies and financial loss on the liquidity provider side, 
but we also see the potential for TWAP attacks on Uniswap V3 oracles. 
For the success of Uniswap V3, it is thus imperative that liquidity providers will become more sophisticated and agile.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This project should consider replacing `quoteAllAvailablePoolsWithTimePeriod` with `quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod`
and selecting a subset of Uniswap V3 pools with sufficient liquidity to avoid price manipulation.
