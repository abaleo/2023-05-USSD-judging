# All swaps in the protocol are executed without slippage protection

## Summary

All swaps in the protocol via Uniswap V3 pools are executed swaps without slippage protection. That will cause a loss of funds because of sandwich attacks. See: https://uniswapv3book.com/docs/milestone_3/slippage-protection/.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `UniV3SwapInput` function of `USSD.sol` is called in multiple places from `USSDRebalancer` only passing the path and the sell amount of the asset to be swapped.

The `amountOutMinimum` parameter which is used for executing the swap is set to a hardcoded 0 for all swaps: https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L237

The parameter is responsible for slippage protection. It makes a swap revert when fewer funds would be returned from the swap than `amountOutMinimum` is set to.

## Impact

All swaps are susceptible to sandwich attacks causing a loss of funds for the protocol.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `amountOutMinimum` should not be set to 0 but to a value representing an acceptable amount of slippage.

But be careful.

Getting an expected amount of returned tokens for a swap can be done via the `quoteExactInput` (https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/periphery/lens/Quoter#quoteexactinput) from Uniswap's V3 `Quoter` contract.

But unlike Uniswap V2, where the equivalent function `getAmountsOut` is a view function, the function in v3 is a non-view function and will cost gas.

Also, it is important to know that the function is not meant to be called on-chain for the purpose of slippage control. Performing a swap in the same transaction that this function is called in would not provide slippage protection. The function may be used off-chain to supply the estimates to a smart contract function.
