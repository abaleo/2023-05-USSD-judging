# Missing redeem functionality

## Summary
Redeem functionality is not implemented.

## Vulnerability Detail
Check out section 4 of the whitepaper, which states: "If there is positive DAI balance in the collateral, USSD contract can provide DAI for equal amount of USSD in return (that would be burned, contracting supply)." Accordingly to the whitepaper, users must have redeem functionality to regain their DAI. Currently, there is no such a way.

## Impact
The protocol cannot fully operate following the whitepaper.
