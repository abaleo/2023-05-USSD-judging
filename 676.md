# Missing access control on `mintRebalancer()` and `burnRebalancer()`

## Summary
Anyone can just mint or burn USSD since the function is public and has no checks. I believe the `burnRebalancer()` should also check if `amount` is a legit value and enough token has been minted first in order to burn them.

## Vulnerability Detail
Missing access control on these 2 functions:

```solidity
    function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        //!! no check if contract has enough tokens to burn
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
(I believe the `burnRebalancer()` should also check if `amount` is a legit value and enough token has been minted first in order to burn them.)

## Impact
Any amount of USSD can be burned or minted by anyone.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the onlyBalancer modifier which is already created in the contract

```solidity
modifier onlyBalancer() {
        require(msg.sender == address(rebalancer), "bal");
        _;
    }
```

So the actual code becomes

```solidity
 function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
        // Also check if contract has enough `amount` tokens to burn
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
