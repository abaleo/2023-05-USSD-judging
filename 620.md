# Lack of checking for stale price data from chainlink oracles can potentially lead to incorrect results and excessive arbitrage opportunities

## Summary

The oracle implementations for all collateral types utilize chainlink oracles, but don't validate whether the returned price data is stale. This is especially problematic as the `mintForToken` function allows for trading collateral 1-1 based on these oracle prices, which can lead to excessive arbitrage opportunities

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation for gathering the price from the chainlink oracle price feeds only gathers and returns the price returned. There are no checks as to whether that price is stale or not:
```solidity
(, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```
This is especially important for this protocol, as the `mintForToken` function allows for converting collateral to USSD at a 1-1 conversion rate using the oracle price. Therefore, if this price is stale, and e.g. the price has moved a non-insignificant amount from the prevailing market price, this will create an arbitrage opportunity, which will allow users to extract value from the protocol.

## Impact

Not checking whether the price data from the chainlink oracles is stale can result in the wrong price being returned, which can result in excessive arbitrage opportunities that will siphon funds from the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checks for determining if the price data is stale:
```solidity
(,int256 price,,uint256 updatedAt,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < PRICE_ORACLE_STALE_THRESHOLD);
```
