# No slippage Parameter where the  `amountOutMinimum` is set to `zero` swaps are prone to `sandwich` attacks
## Summary
the  `UniV3SwapInput ` function in the  `USSD ` contract sets the  `amountOutMinimum ` to zero, which makes it prone to sandwich attacks. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is in the   `USSD ` contract at the  `UniV3SwapInput ` function.
   ```solidity
   function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                //@audit the slippage is set to zero, leaving the swap vunerable to sandwich attacks.
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```

This function is called by the  `contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol` contract when it wants to perform swaps concerning  `USSD ` in order to  `Rebalance `, the issue is the  `amountOutMinimum ` is set to zero meaning it can accept to take as much as  `zero ` amount of tokens when performing swaps in order to  `Rebalance`, which is bad and when  `Sandwiched ` by an attacker, the attacker can increase the price of  `tokens ` which will lead to getting little amount of tokens than intended even down to o amount of token(dust amount), and the attacker would then back back run the buyer to sell the other token, gaining almost all the `tokens`. read this [MEV bot sandwich attacks](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-sandwich-attack-explain-776f6f43b2fd).
This issue is a very `common` issue as it has happened a lot of times. 
To quote philosopher `George Santayana`, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”


## Impact
> Impact ~ **High**

> Likelihood ~ **High**

Sandwich attacks are very common on the Ethereum mainet.
**POC**
the `rebalancer` rebalances ussd by selling the `collateral` and burning the `ussd` for peg down recovery, in this case there isn't an issue but for the situation for peg up recovery it buys the `collateral` and mints more `ussd`, and the `UniV3SwapInput` function is the essential function for this `mechansim`, where the `rebalancer` was made public for good reasons(to make ussd as `Autonomous` as possible, and making it resistant to `centralization` risks) this `mechanism` allows for manipulation, where a malicious actor can call the `rebalancer` function and where the contract needs peg up recovery(tries to buy more collateral and mints more ussd) the attacker can `sandwich` that transaction due to the zero `slippage` that allows for recieving zero amount of `tokens` when performing the `swap`,this causes an inbalance in the system, here the attacker has stolen the `DAI` intended to be gotten by `ussd`, although i haven't made proper calculation as to the amount of damage it could cause it done over and over and over again, but i could sure tell that it would not be good for this `protocol`.

## Tool used

Manual Analysis

## Recommendation
A Good `solution` would be for the developers to set the `slippage` to a strict amount where the swaps would revert if such an attack is performed on it.
