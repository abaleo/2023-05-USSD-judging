# No slippage Parameter where the  `amountOutMinimum` is set to `zero` swaps are prone to `sandwich` attacks

# No slippage Parameter where the  `amountOutMinimum` is set to `zero` swaps are prone to `sandwich` attacks
## Summary
the  `UniV3SwapInput ` function in the  `USSD ` contract sets the  `amountOutMinimum ` to zero, which makes it prone to sandwich attacks. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is in the   `USSD ` contract at the  `UniV3SwapInput ` function.
   ``` solidity
   function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                //@audit the slippage is set to zero, meaning users can
                accrue a loss by getting zero amount of tokens from the swap
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```

This function is called by the  `contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol` contract when it wants to perform swaps concerning  `USSD `, the issue is the  `amountOutMinimum ` is set to zero meaning it can accept to take as much as  `zero ` amount of tokens when performing swaps, which is bad and when frontrunned by an attacker, the attacker can increase the price of tokens which will lead to getting little amount of tokens than intended even down to o amount of token(dust amount), and the attacker would then back back run the buyer to sell the other token, gaining almost all the user's tokens. read this [MEV bot sandwich attacks](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-sandwich-attack-explain-776f6f43b2fd).
This issue is a very common issue as it has happened a lot of times. 
To quote philosopher George Santayana, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”


## Impact
> Impact ~ **High**

> Likelihood ~ **High**

Sandwich attacks are very common on the Ethereum mainet and due to the  `amountOutMinimum ` being set to  `zero `, users can lose their entire funds by interacting with that function.

## Tool used

Manual Analysis

## Recommendation
Users should be able to input their own slippage check and the amazing devs should also provide a sensible default slippage in case the user doesn't specify a value, but user-specified slippage parameters must always override platform defaults.
