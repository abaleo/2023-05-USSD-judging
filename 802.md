# Missing slippage control in swaps

## Summary
`USSD.UniV3SwapInput()` allows large slippage to occurr when swapping. This is vulnerable to sandwich attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can see before-hand which collateral are going to be swapped during a rebalance, and perform a classic sandwich attack on the rebalance. Say for example 1 WBTC is going to be swapped for DAI in during the rebalance. For simplicity assume that the `pathsell` is just a single swap on the WBTC/DAI uniswap pool.
1. Attacker frontruns with a swap of WBTC for DAI, the spot price of the pool is reduced.
2. During rebalancing: Price of WBTC is taken from oracle to compute the amount to swap. `USSDRebalancer` doesn't know the pool has been manipulated
3. During rebalancing: Swap 1 WBTC for DAI at a worse price than market price
4. Attacker backruns with a swap of DAI for WBTC at a better price than market.

The attacker gained some WBTC and the protocol got less DAI than expected from the swap.

## Impact
Collateral can be drained from the protocol over time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider reverting if the current pool spot price is too far from the oracle price before swapping. This will avoid the price to be manipulated prior to the swap, and so will avoid sandwich attacks.
