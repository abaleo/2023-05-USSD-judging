# Wrong calculation in WBTC oracle

## Summary

Wrong calculation in WBTC oracle.

## Vulnerability Detail

WBTC oracle would use BTC/USD Chainlink priceFeef. However, while WBTC is pegged to BTC price it's not always the same. So for correct evaluation of WBTC collateral amount should be used ratio of WBTC/BTC and BTC/USD chainlink priceFeeds.

## Impact

The price of WBTC would be wrongly evaluated as the price of BTC, which is not always the same. Resulting in incorrect collateral evaluation.
