# onlyBalancer() required

## Summary
`mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions have to be callable only by the balancer.

## Vulnerability Detail
`mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions are open to public, so anyone can call it to mint and burn USSD to the smart contract itself.

## Impact
If USSD can be minted and burned by anyone (even though the beneficiary is the contract itself), it modifies the totalSupply, which will affect collateral factor and the balancer behavior and can cause unexpected results.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `onlyBalancer` modifier to those methods, so that only the balancer can mint/burn USSD
