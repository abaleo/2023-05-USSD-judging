# Rebalancer executes swaps without slippage protection

## Summary
The rebalancer contract calls `USSD#UniV3SwapInput` function that executes swaps without slippage protection. That will cause a loss of funds because of sandwich attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `UniV3SwapInput` function calls the Uniswap V3 function `ExactInputParams` to perform swaps (used to rebalance the protocol) but it is setting the param `amountOutMinimum` to 0, meaning there is no slippage protection in this swap.

Here is a similar report in the past: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby-judging/issues/64

## Impact

Having set the `amountOutMinimum` param to 0 means there is no slippage protection in the swap. Therefore swaps will be sandwiched causing a loss of funds every time the protocol rebalances.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Slippage parameter should be included in the function call and not be 0.
