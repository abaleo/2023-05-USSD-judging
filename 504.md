# Mismatch between protocol logic and doc's claim

Pheonix - Mistmatch between what docs state vs what it actually implements  

Medium 
## Summary
Mistmatch between what docs state vs what it actually implements 

## Vulnerability Detail
As per the documentation of USSD stable coin , it states under [[ 3 USSD Supply Management ]] quote 
>USSD coin is ’initialized’ with one-time minting of 1000 USSD, taking 1000
>DAI as collateral. This 1000 USSD would allow to create a pool USSD/DAI to
>have initial liquidity. 

However , the contracts implementation of initial [minting logic](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L42-L43) mints 10k ussd to create initial pool 

## Impact
Minting 10,000 USSD instead of 1,000 as documented could result in an increased supply of USSD tokens. This could potentially lead to inflationary effects or dilution of existing token holders' value, especially if the additional supply is not properly backed by collateral or there are no mechanisms in place to mitigate the impact.

May cause confusion and erode trust among users and developers who rely on accurate information. Inconsistencies can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, or the perception that the protocol team is not adequately managing or communicating important aspects of the protocol.

Creates a mismatch between the expected and actual initial liquidity of the USSD/DAI pool. If the protocol relies on the initial minted amount ( which it does ) for its operations or assumes a specific liquidity level, this discrepancy could lead to unexpected behavior or inefficiencies in the protocol's functioning.

```solidity 
        // mint 10k USSD to create initial pool
        _mint(msg.sender, 10_000 * 1e6);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either update the documentation or change the minting logic to only mint 1k ussd as per the documentation
