# USSDRebalancer.sol::SellUSSDBuyCollateral incorrectly assumes reversions

## Summary 

USSDRebalancer.sol::SellUSSDBuyCollateral incorrectly assumes reversions

## Vulnerability Detail

USSDRebalancer.sol::SellUSSDBuyCollateral - The code is aiming to sell USSD and buy collateral.

The issue is that it incorrectly assumes a revert if buying DAO fails twice.

## Impact

As there is no reversion, the code block continues to work as if the USSD sell was successful.

This will lead to an imbalance in USSD holdings and collateral, impacting the functionality of the protocol significantly.

As shown in the code snippet below, they get daibought from `IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD)`

Now if the buying dai action fails, the result of the calculation `IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought` is the same as saying `x - x`.

The answer to this will always equal 0, meaning that the transaction will NOT revert and the large code block will continue to run as if it did work [code block 1].

The code will continue to run and will reach the final for loop, which specifically states in a comment 'don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)' [code block 2].


## Code Snippet

Block 1

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L163C9-L175

```solidity
function SellUSSDBuyCollateral() internal {
      ...

      if (uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token0(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token1())), amount);

        // @audit This would not revert if not bought
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
      } else {
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(uniPool.token1(), hex"0001f4", uniPool.token0())), amount);

        // @audit This would not revert if not bought
        daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought; // would revert if not bought
      }
```

Block 2

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L196C33-L204

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++) {
    ...

        if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {

        // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
        IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have a require statement to ensure the daibought is greater than 0.

```solidity
    ...

    daibought = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - daibought;
    require(daibought > 0, "Failed to buy DAI");
```
