# Need to check the result from `safeTransferFrom`

## Summary
In `mintForToken` function in `USSD.sol`, it should check the result from `safeTransferFrom` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Some ERC20 tokens does not revert on token transfer failure but returns false as result
But it's not checking the result from `safeTransferFrom` function.

2. Some ERC20 tokens apply fees on transfer
But it's not checking the balance difference between before/after token transfer to see if exact amount has been transferred.

## Impact
1. It will impact the protocol by minting USSD without receiving collateral.
2. It will impact the protocol by minting more USSD with receiving less collateral amount.

## Recommendation
1. Check the result from `safeTransferFrom` function to check if the result was true.
2. Check the balance difference after `safeTransferFrom` function to see if exact amount of token is received.
