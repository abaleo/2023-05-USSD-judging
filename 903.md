# Improper conditioning

## Summary
An unlikely conditional branch is described in `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`.
The implementation may be different from the intention and may show unexpected behavior for the project.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`, `if (collateral[i].token ! = uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token ! = uniPool.token1()))` if statement. This means that the entire statement is false only if `collateral[i].token == uniPool.token0() == uniPool.token1()`. However, since `uniPool` applies either USSD or DAI to token0 or 1(be exclusive), the above condition is always true.
## Impact
There is a high possibility that the implementation is different from the developer's expectation, and unscheduled swap processing may be performed.
