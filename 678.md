# Wrong decimal number on DAI/ETH Chainlink priceFeed

## Summary

Wrong decimal number on DAI/ETH Chainlink priceFeed.

## Vulnerability Detail

DAI oracle uses DAI/ETH Chainlink priceFeed for evaluation of the correct DAI price. However, it was used with the wrong assumption that this priceFeed has 8 decimals, while it has 18 decimals:
```solidity
        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD, so multiply by 10 decimals to get 18 decimal fractional
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();

        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```

## Impact

Price of DAI token would be wrongly evaluated due to additional multiplication to 1e10.

## Recommendation

Consider removing the multiplication of DAI/ETH CHainlink priceFeed result to 1e10, since its value already has 18 decimals.
