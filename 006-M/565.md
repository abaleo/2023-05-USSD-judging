# Risk of loss of funds when calling `mintForToken`


## Summary

The `mintForToken` function inside USSD contract does no implement slippage protection when minting USSD tokens for a given input token (collateral), this puts the user at risk of MEV attacks because the input token price may vary between the moment the user submit the mint transaction and when it's executed and thus user can potentially lose funds when calling this function in case of a high price fluctuations.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue occurs in the `mintForToken` function below :

```solidity
/// Mint specific AMOUNT OF STABLE by giving token
function mintForToken(
    address token,
    uint256 tokenAmount,
    address to
) public returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
    require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token");

    IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        tokenAmount
    );
    stableCoinAmount = calculateMint(token, tokenAmount);
    // @audit No check on stableCoinAmount => No slippage protection
    // There is Risk of MEV attack
    _mint(to, stableCoinAmount);

    emit Mint(msg.sender, to, token, tokenAmount, stableCoinAmount);
}
```

As you can see the `mintForToken` function does not check the USSD amount to mint returned by the `calculateMint` function, the `calculateMint` function uses the actual input token price to calculates the minted amount, so if the user mint transaction is not exceuted immediately (stays in the mempool for some time) and the price of the token changes (fluctuate in large amounts) then the user can receive a smaller amount of USSD compared to what he has expected thus leading to a loss of funds.

This issue can happen in normal condition (large price fluctuation in a volatile market) or can be caused a MEV attack against the user transaction.

## Impact

Large price fluctuation or MEV attack when the `mintForToken` function is called can lead to loss of funds for the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend to add a slippage protection in the `mintForToken` function, this can be done by adding a minAmountReceived variable in the call and checking if the returned USSD amount is above it or not.

The function can be modified as follows :

```solidity
/// Mint specific AMOUNT OF STABLE by giving token
function mintForToken(
    address token,
    uint256 tokenAmount,
    address to,
    uint256 minAmountReceived
) public returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
    require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token");

    IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        tokenAmount
    );
    stableCoinAmount = calculateMint(token, tokenAmount);

    // @audit Add slippage protection
    if (stableCoinAmount < minAmountReceived) revert();

    _mint(to, stableCoinAmount);

    emit Mint(msg.sender, to, token, tokenAmount, stableCoinAmount);
}
```
