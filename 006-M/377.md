# Minting exposes users to unlimited slippage

## Summary
The current implementation of `mintForToken` function lacks a slippage control parameter, making them vulnerable to front-run attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The minting function `mintForToken` transfers a specified amount of a foreign token from the user to the USSD contract. It then calculates the amount of the protocol's native token to mint based on the transferred `tokenAmount`. However, the code does not include any mechanism to account for slippage, i.e., the potential difference between the expected and executed prices during the token swap.
## Impact
The absence of a slippage parameter means that users are susceptible to unlimited slippage. Slippage occurs when the executed price of a trade significantly deviates from the expected price due to market volatility or insufficient liquidity. Without a slippage parameter, users have no control over the maximum acceptable slippage, making their minting transactions vulnerable to unfavorable price fluctuations.
## Code Snippet
[USSD.sol#L151-L167](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L151-L167)
```solidity
    function mintForToken(
        address token,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address to
    ) public returns (uint256 stableCoinAmount) {
        require(hasCollateralMint(token), "unsupported token");

        IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            tokenAmount
        );
        stableCoinAmount = calculateMint(token, tokenAmount);
        _mint(to, stableCoinAmount);

        emit Mint(msg.sender, to, token, tokenAmount, stableCoinAmount);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Consider adding a `minAmountOut` parameter.
