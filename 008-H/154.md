# `mintRebalancer()` and `burnRebalancer()` functions lack access control, allowing anyone to call them

## Summary
The lack of permission controls in the mintRebalancer() and burnRebalancer() functions allows for potential manipulation of the totalSupply, which can undermine the integrity and effectiveness of the rebalancing logic in the SellUSSDBuyCollateral() function.

## Vulnerability Detail
These two functions, mintRebalancer and burnRebalancer, do not have any access control mechanisms in place. This lack of access control can lead to potential security risks and vulnerabilities. Anyone can call these functions and mint or burn tokens from the address(this) account.
```solidity
 function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
Inisde the `SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` function, the line of code `uint ownval = (getOwnValuation() * 1e18 / 1e6) * IUSSD(USSD).totalSupply() / 1e6; // 1e18 total USSD value` calculates the total value of USSD tokens in the system by multiplying the valuation obtained from getOwnValuation() by the total supply of USSD tokens.  As the code below ,if the ratio of the collateral asset's value to the total USSD value (collateralval * 1e18 / ownval) falls below the desired collateral ratio specified by collateral[i].ratios[flutter], the portions variable is incremented. In the loop iteration,If the condition is met, the function calls IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput() with the corresponding collateral[i].pathbuy to swap a portion of the purchased DAI (daibought/portions) for the collateral asset.
```solidity
  uint ownval = (getOwnValuation() * 1e18 / 1e6) * IUSSD(USSD).totalSupply() / 1e6; // 1e18 total USSD value
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++) {
        uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;
        if (collateralval * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[i].ratios[flutter]) {
          portions++;
        }
      }

      for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++) {
        uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;
        if (collateralval * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[i].ratios[flutter]) {
          if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {
            // don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
          }
        }
      }
```
The mintRebalancer() and burnRebalancer() functions allow any address to mint or burn tokens. This means that the total supply of tokens can be easily manipulated by any user of the contract. As a result, the calculation of ownval in the SellUSSDBuyCollateral() function, which relies on the totalSupply, may not reflect the actual value of USSD tokens in circulation.

This manipulation of the totalSupply can have significant implications for the subsequent loop operations within the SellUSSDBuyCollateral() function. The loop relies on accurate values of collateral assets and their respective ratios to determine which assets need to be adjusted. However, if the totalSupply is artificially increased or decreased through minting or burning tokens, the calculation of ownval and subsequent comparisons may no longer accurately reflect the actual state of the collateral structure.

## Impact
Therefore, the lack of permission controls in the mintRebalancer() and burnRebalancer() functions allows for potential manipulation of the totalSupply, which can undermine the integrity and effectiveness of the rebalancing logic in the SellUSSDBuyCollateral() function.

## Recommendation
Add a modifier  `onlyBalancer` to restrict these functions to be called only by a specific authorized address
