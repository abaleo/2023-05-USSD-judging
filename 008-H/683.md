# `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` do not use the `onlyBalancer` modifier which means that anyone can call them and mint/burn any amount of tokens to the contract

## Summary
The 2 functions that can mint tokens to the contract and burn tokens from the contract don't use the `onlyBalancer` modifier and since they are public anyone can call it with any arbitrary amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the case of rebalancing the `USSDRebalancer.sol` has the function `rebalance` that can be called by anyone which will `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` or `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`. If the rebalancing will `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` then it will mint some USSD and buy DAI tokens from the pool, but since anyone can call the mint function with any amount, this can hurt the protocol by minting a very big amount of tokens to get as many DAI as possible from the pool, which can de-peg the USSD.
## Impact
De-pegging can hurt the protocol since people could lose trust and the FUD could make everybody to want to swap their USSD for the collateral.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the `onlyBalancer` modifier to those 2 functions so only the modifier can mint/burn tokens
