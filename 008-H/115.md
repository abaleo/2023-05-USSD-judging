# Missing access control on mint/burn functions.

## Summary
Anyone can call `mint()` and `burn()` and mint USSD to the protocol. This can devastate the protocol allowing infinite mint. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can call `mint()` and `burn()` and mint USSD to the protocol. This can devastate the protocol allowing infinite mint. 
## Impact
This will ruin the protocol and either dilute or burn all USSD in the contract which will lead to most all functionality falling apart.
