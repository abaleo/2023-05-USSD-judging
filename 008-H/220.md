# mintRebalancer and burnRebalancer can be called by anyone

## Summary
In the `USSD` contract, the functions `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` are used to mint and burn USSD funds in the USSD contract by the `USSDRebalancer` contract. But since those two functions are public and without a modifier protecting them, they can be called by anyone.

## Vulnerability Detail
`mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` can be called by anyone, when it is intended to be called only by the `USSDRebalancer` contract.

## Impact
Since those minted or burned funds obtained from calling those functions are added to the USSD contract and not the caller, this is not a critical issue but it is still an issue that could be used together with other potential issues to escalate the problem and create a much more dangerous exploit.

Also, since anyone can mint to the USSD contract any amount of tokens, it can mess with the supply stats tracked by different third party tools, since those minted funds are not pegged funds and thus, they are not real.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the modifer `onlyBalancer` to those functions:

```solidity
function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public onlyBalancer override {
   _mint(address(this), amount);
}

function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public onlyBalancer override {
   _burn(address(this), amount);
}
```
