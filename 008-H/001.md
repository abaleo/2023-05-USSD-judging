# Tokens can be issued infinitely

## Summary
The `mintRebalancer(uint256 amount)` function can be called by everyone, which will lead to unlimited issuance of `UUSD` without any collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `USSD.sol` file, the `mintRebalancer(uint256 amount)` function can be called by anyone:

```solidity
function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
    _mint(address(this), amount);
}
```

It will cause unlimited issuance of tokens and malicious price manipulation.

For example, if an attacker called the `mintRebalancer(uint256 amount)` with a large `amount` before the `rebalance()` function(In USSDRebalancer.sol), then it will affect the price in the uniswap pool, there are a lot of `UUSD` and almost 0 `DAI` in the pool. And the attacker can use a little `DAI` to swap a lot of `UUSD`.

## Impact
Unlimited issuance of tokens and malicious price manipulation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `onlyBalancer` modifier to `mintRebalancer(uint256 amount)` function:

```solidity
modifier onlyBalancer() {
    require(msg.sender == address(rebalancer), "bal");
    _;
}
function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
    _mint(address(this), amount);
}
```
