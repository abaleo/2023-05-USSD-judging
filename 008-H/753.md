# Missing guard on `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer`

## Summary
In functions `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer`, no checks are present. It was supposed to be called only by rebalancer.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can call `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions and control totalSupply of the token.
Since the `collateralFactor` is dependent on totalSupply (`return (totalAssetsUSD * 1e6) / totalSupply()`), one can increase or decrease collateralFactor.
Increasing collateralFactor is beneficial when minting USSD. Decreasing collateral factor is beneficial when redeeming USSD.
This can lead to larger than expected USSD or collateral tokens to the caller. `rebalance()` is public.

## Impact
User can mint more USSD and sell thus dumping USSD price. Rebalancing mechanism will be broken.
As this will escalate into cycle of depeg->rebalance->depeg->rebalance, there's plenty of room for the user to manipulate collateralFactor.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rename `onlyBalancer` to `onlyRebalancer` and add that modifier to `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer`.
