# Lack of access control in `mintRebalancer()` and `burnRebalancer()`

## Summary
`mintRebalancer()` and `burnRebalancer()` function are set public allowing anyone to mint or burn USSD tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`mintRebalancer()` and `burnRebalancer()` are used in USSDRebalancer.sol's `rebalance()` function to adjust supply of USSD in order to maintain the peg.
But here, both the functions are marked public resulting in anyone being able to mint tokens to USSD contract or burn tokens of USSD contracts, essentially controlling the supply of USSD token. 

## Impact
1. A malicious user can potentially exploit this to perform DOS attack, by minting 2**256  tokens to USSD contract, blocking mint functionality until someone burns the extra tokens. 
2. Potential integration problems for other protocols which will be relying on `totalSupply()` as well as `collateralFactor()`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add appropriate access control, only allow rebalancer to call these function. i.e. `onlyRebalancer()` modifier.
