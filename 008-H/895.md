# No access control for mintRebalancer and burnRebalancer

## Summary
Anyone can mint USSD to USSD contract

## Vulnerability Detail
I believe that `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions suppose only be called from `USSDRebalancer`, but it's not enforced and anyone can do it

## Impact
`collateralFactor()` can be manipulated and more, but i think it's just a typo

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `onlyBalancer` modifier
