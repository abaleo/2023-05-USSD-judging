# Disable mint function

## Summary
Anyone can mint USSD to a USSD address.
The process of exchanging collateral and tokens can be front-run and the minting process can be disabled for the user by minting the USSD to the maximum value against the USSD address.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintRebalancer (uint256 amount)` allows anyone to mint any amount of USSD to a USSD address at any time.
The core function of this contract, `mintForToken`, includes the process `_mint(to, stableCoinAmount)`, which attempts to mint USSD for `to`.
If someone front-runs this function call and mints the maximum USSD with `mintRebalancer`, `mintForToken` will always revert and this function can be disabled.
## Impact
User loses gas money. The underlying operation of the protocol is disabled.
