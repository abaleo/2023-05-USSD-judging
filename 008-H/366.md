# Anyone can mint more USSD tokens

## Summary
Anyone can call `USSD.mintRebalancer` function, which would increase the total supply and manipulate the collateral factor.

## Vulnerability Detail
`USSD` has a function `mintRebalancer` which mints new tokens for the USSD address. The issue is that anyone can call this function.
```solidity
    function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override { // @audit - Anyone can mint
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }
```

## Impact
Anyone can manipulate total supply, which affects `collateralFactor`.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-L206
```solidity
    function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override { 
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the function is meant to be called by rebalancer only, add the `onlyBalancer` modifier to the function.
```solidity
    function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }
```
