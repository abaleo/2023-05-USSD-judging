# Burn and mint functions are public

## Summary
The `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions in `USSD.sol` are publicly accessible, allowing anyone to call them. This represents a high severity issue as it enables unauthorized users to mint or burn tokens at will, potentially disrupting the token economy and causing financial loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
1): Unauthorized Token Creation: Any user, including malicious actors, can call the mintRebalancer function and create tokens at will. This can lead to an inflationary issue, as the token supply can be increased without proper control or validation. 
This scenerio has been happened before in `safeMoon` token as explained here https://www.zellic.io/blog/safemoon-exploit-explained

2): Uncontrolled Token Burn: Similarly, any user can call the burnRebalancer function and burn tokens without proper authorization. This can result in a deflationary issue, reducing the token supply and potentially causing imbalances within the token ecosystem cause the peg to break


## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-L210

```solidity
function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `onlyBalancer` modified on these two functions
