# Lack of access control on `mintRebalancer` function can lead to bricking core protocol functionality

## Summary

The lack of access control on the `mintRebalancer` function of the USSD contract allows for any user to mint an arbitrary amount to that contract, resulting in bricking core protocol functionality when a user mints the entire supply

## Vulnerability Detail

The USSD contract has functionality that allows any user to mint an arbitrary amount of USSD tokens to that contract's address. The issue is that any user can mint up to the entire supply of that token, meaning that any future call to `_mint` will result in an overflow when the totalSupply is increased in the underlying ERC20 token. Multiple core functions rely on calling `_mint`, including `mintForToken` and `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`. Although there is also no access control for the `burnRebalancer` function meaning any user can reverse this action, a malicious user can simply front-run any function calls by calling `mintRebalancer`, preventing those functions from ever working.

## Impact

A user can brick core functionality by minting the entire supply of the USSD token, which will prevent any functions which call `_mint` from functioning, including `mintForToken` and `SellUSSDBuyCollateral`

## Recommendation

Add the `onlyBalancer` modifier to both the `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions.
