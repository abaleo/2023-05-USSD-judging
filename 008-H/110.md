# mintRebelancer() can be called outside of rebalance() function

## Summary

mintRebalancer() can be called by anyone due to lack of access control

## Vulnerability Detail

Although rebalance() function is public and it's said in documentation, inside of it there is a call to mintRebalancer() that should be done only under certain conditions that is: else if (ownval > 1e6 + threshold). It means if the value of USSD is too high then the protocol buys more collateral and creates more USSD to decrease the value (according to the specification).

## Impact

High-risk vulnerability. Any amount of USSD can be created by anybody due to lack of access control and public visibility of the mintRebalancer(). And therefore the value of USSD can be completely depreciated.

## Code Snippet

## Recommendation

Add onlyBalancer() modifier or another access control.
