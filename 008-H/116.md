# An Attacker can steal all the collateral by abusing the rebalance function and causing imbalances on the Uniswap Pool

## Summary
An Attacker can cause the USSD/DAI Uniswap Pool to run out of DAI liquidity, which will alter the DAI => USSD conversion, which will make the attacker capable of getting a huge amount of USSD by sending a couple of DAIs to the pool in this imbalance state, then the same attacker can call the USSDRebalancer.rebalance() to make the protocol sell the stored collateral to rebalance the Uni Pool by injecting the DAI liquidity back so USSD pegs back to the USD, and when the Uni Pool has again DAI liquidity, the attacker can go and swap all the USSDs that got when the Uni Pool was in the imbalance state, but this time it will get a 1-1 conversion from USSD to DAI.

The attacker can repeat this process as many times as he wants until all the collateral stored on the protocol has been sold off and the attacker has taken all the collateral's value in the form of DAI.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Phase 1, Option 1: The price by itself has gone up the peg, which will make the [rebalance() function follow the path to SellUSSDBuyCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L98-L105), in this case, the attacker only needs to front run the tx to rebalance the pool and mint the infinite number of USSD tokens into the USSD contract by calling the  [USDD.mintRebalancer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-L206)

- Phase 1, Option 2: The attacker has already manipulated the price of the Uni Pool so when calling the rebalance() it will follow the path to ["mint and buy collateral" when calling the USSDRebalancer.rebalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L98-L105), then the **Attacker calls the [USDD.mintRebalancer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-L206)** and mints a tremendous number of USSD tokens into the USSD contract, 

  -  At the end of Phase 1, regarding which of the two options was used, the **USSD/DAI Uni Pool will be in an imbalance state, where it has close to 0 DAI, and a tremendous amount of USSD, which that will affect the conversion of DAI => USSD**

- Phase 2, the Attacker swaps DAI for USSD when the pool is in the imbalance state. **Swapping DAI, when the pool is in this state, will give in return a big amount of USSD, 10,20,30 times the amount of DAI that is sent to the Pool**

- Phase 3, once the Attacker has swapped a huge number of USSD for himself, the attacker calls the [USSDRebalancer.rebalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L92) which now will follow the [path to recover the peg by BuyUSSDSellCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L95-L97), the result of this phase it will be that the protocol will start to sell the stored collateral for DAI which then will be used to buy USSD from the imbalanced pool (USSD/DAI), and at the end, it will burn all the USSD that is on the USSD contract.

  - At the end of Phase 3, the protocol has sold off a portion of their stored collateral to recover the peg on the uni pool, which means that now the swap of USSD => DAI is 1-1 (Or the closest possible)

- Phase 4, now that the pool has recovered its peg (or the most that it could), the attacker can go and swap the huge amount of USSD that got himself by swapping a small number of DAI when the pool was imbalanced. This time the attacker will get the same amount of DAI for all the USSD with a conversion rate of 1-1

- **The final result** will be the attacker slowly draining the collateral of the protocol by causing the USSD/DAI pool to fall into the imbalance state and the attacker swapping a bunch of USSD when the pool is imbalanced, and then when the pool is balanced back, go and swap the USSD.
  - The attacker can repeat as many times as required to drain the whole collateral stored by the protocol.

## Impact
All the collateral deposited in the protocol is at risk of being stolen by an attacker

## Recommendation
- To prevent this issue from being a problem, make sure to **add a Control Access Restriction to the [mintRebalancer() function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-L206)**
