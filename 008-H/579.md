# Lacking protection of mintRebalancer  and burnRebalancer could give users control over ussd price

## Summary
There is no modifier to guard these functions, so anyone can call these functions. Users can abuse these functions to maliciously manipulate ussd price.
## Vulnerability Detail
By abusing these functions , users can manipulate total supply and collateral factor of ussd which are used to determine the amount of collateral bought by the system, which ultimately affect ussd price.
## Impact
Users can indirectly manipulate the amount of collateral bought by the system
