# Unlimit supply cap for token in USSD.sol.

## Summary
There is no max supply cap for token in this contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `mintForToken` does not have access control, everyone such as Alice can use the function keep mint an excessive amount of coins,  then leading to inflation and devaluation of the token. Even the `calculateMint` function provide a limit on how much tokens can be minted per transaction.

However, it does not prevent inflation or devaluation from excessive minting, especially if the user has a large amount of asset token.

## Impact
No prevention for inflation or devaluation from excessive minting, especially if the user has an enormous amount of asset token.
