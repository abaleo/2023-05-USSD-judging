# Attacker can burn all the USSD tokens owned by USSD contract

## Summary
Attacker can burn all the USSD tokens owned by USSD contract due to the lack of access control.

## Vulnerability Detail
In **USSD.sol**, [burnRebalancer(...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L208-L210) is used to burn USSD tokens owned by USSD contract, this is supposed to be called only when rebalancing, however, there is no access control to this function and it could be called by anyone.
```solidity
    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```

## Impact
An attacker may front-run rebalancing transction and burn all the USSD tokens owned by USSD contract, so rebalancing transaction will revert because of there is no USSD tokens to sell.

## Recommendation
[burnRebalancer(...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L208-L210) is supposed to be call by USSDRebalancer, so please add onlyBalancer modifier to this function:
```solidity
    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
