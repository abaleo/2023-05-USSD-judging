# Price manipulation through open minting and rebalancing of assets to steal USSD collaterals

## Summary
The USSDRebalancer is in charge of rebalancing the USSD/DAI pools, as the minting and burning functions are open for anyone to call, by using a certain mix of function calls pool price can be manipulated to extract all the collaterals inside USSD
## Vulnerability Detail
The USSDRebalancer contract is in charge of rebalancing the value of USSD in accordance with USSD/DAI pool through the [rebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#LL92C15-L92C15) function, this function can have 2 logical paths, it either consider the asset over-pegged or under-pegged, if it's over-pegged it's selling USSD and buying collateral and if it's under-pegged it's buying USSD and selling collateral.  As anyone can call the mintRebalance & burnRebalance functions, the order of calls can be manipulated to steal all the collateral inside USSD. 
## Impact
POC: 
1. The USSD is in an over-pegged state. ( 1 USSD = 1.02.... DAI ) 
2. The USSD/DAI pool holds 10k USSD and 10.2k DAI
3.  An attacker calls the mintRebalance function with a big amount ( 10 millions - 200 USSD ), the USSD contract holds 10 millions - 200  USSD in it's balance.
4. Attacker calls the rebalance() function ( or frontrun someone that calls rebalance function by fist calling mintRebalance ) 
5.  As the USSD is in an over-pegged state, the rebalance will first mint 200 USSD ( [DAiamount - USSDamount ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#LL104C17-L104C17) --> math reduced for example purposes ), now USSD contract will hold 10 millions USSD.
6. Next it will call the [SellUSSDBuyCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#LL163C1-L163C1) here it's first [reading the amount of USSD tokens that the USSD contract holds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#LL164C11-L164C11), here is where the problem is originating, because the developer expect that the amount will be equal with the USSD tokens the contract minted one previous step, however if you call the mintRebalance function before them, it will also hold the total balance minted ( 10 millions USSD instead of 200 USSD )
7. Now the contract will sell the total amount of USSD tokens it holds into the USSD/DAI Uniswap pool, buying ~10k DAI for 10 millions USSD, drastically reducing the value of USSD. 
8. The attack go ahead and buys tons of USSD very cheap. 
9. Now the USSD it's in under-pegged state, the attacker calls again the rebalance functions and the contract will use all it's collaterals to buy DAI and then buy USSD with all the dai to bring them again to an ~1:1 ratio. ( In this example we assume they have enough collateral inside USSD to re-peg the tokens ) 
9. Sell the USSD tokens. bough really cheap for all the DAI in the liqudity pool this way you extracted all the collateral the USSD had

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Make the mintRebalancer & burnRebalancer to only be called by the USSDRebalancer. 
2. Add slippage protection inside the UniV3SwapInput function. 
3. Calculate the amount of USSD you need to sell based on DAIamount  - USSDamount directly and not through the balanceOf function.
