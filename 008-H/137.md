```solidity

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override { 
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }

## Recommendation

Update the function to include the `onlyBalancer` modifier, allowing on the the balancer to call `burnRebalancer`

        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }

```
