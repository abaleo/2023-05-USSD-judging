# The Entire Funtionality Of The `USSD` Protocol Can Be `Corrupted`.

[Line of Code](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSD.sol#L204)

## Summary
The Visibility of the `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions is set to `Public` with no `modifier` to ensure that only `trusted` party can call it, meaning the function can be called by `Anyone`.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no `modifier` to protect the `mintRebalncer` and `burnRebalancer`  functions from being called by anyone which leaves the contract prone to malicious parties who can call these functions at any time to `mint` or `burn` any amount of `USSD` tokens.
In the USSD contract

```solidity
    function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
This function is supposed to be called only by the `rebalancer` contract but without the modifier to check the `mint` and `burn` functions respectively, it can be called by anyone especially malicious actors to `Mint` or `Burn` any amount of `USSD` tokens in that contract
## Impact
Malicious actors can `burn` all the tokens and intentionally disrupt the `tokenSupply`, create artificial scarcity or `Inflation`, `manipulate` prices, or `Exploit` imbalances in the system for personal gain.

This can also lead to the `malfunction` of the `Rebalancer` contract causing it to wrongly `adjust` the distribution of tokens within the pool.
This Issue is `Critical` and the `likelihood` is `High` as it costs little to no amount to cause such extreme `Damage` to the Protocol.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This issue can be fixed by simply adding the missing modifier `onlyBalancer` which ensures that only the rebalancer contract can call this function to the `mintReblancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions

```solidity
    function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```

This will implement a strict `authorization` process on the function making sure it can only be called by the right `party`.
