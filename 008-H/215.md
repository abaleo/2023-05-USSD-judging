# USDD token supply can be changed at any point by any EOA account

## Summary
The `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions in the smart contract lack proper access control, allowing anyone to execute these functions. This vulnerability enables unauthorized users to mint an unlimited number of tokens to the contract and burn existing tokens from the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions in the `USDD.sol` smart contract lack access control mechanisms and modifiers. As a result, any externally owned account (EOA) can freely call these functions, allowing unauthorized users to mint and burn USDD tokens without any restrictions. 
This vulnerability poses a risk of unauthorized token creation and alteration of the total token supply. 

## Impact
USDD token supply can be changed at any point by any EOA account in the blockchain

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implementing proper access control measures and modifiers is crucial.
Add the `onlyBalancer` modifier to the mentioned function to only allow it to be executed by a balancer contract.
