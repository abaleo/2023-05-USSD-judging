# Missing Permission Check in USSD.sol Allows Unauthorized Minting and Burning of USSD Tokens

## Summary
`USSD.sol` contains a vulnerability where certain critical functions lack permission checks, enabling anyone to mint and burn USSD tokens in USSD contract without appropriate authorization. This issue can lead to undesired changes in the circulation of USSD tokens and compromise the trustworthiness of the USSD token.

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` in `USSD.sol` do not include permission checks such as `onlyRebalancer`. As a result, anyone can interact with the USSD contract and mint or burn USSD tokens without the necessary authorization or restrictions.

Example vulnerable functions:

```solidity
    function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override { //@audit permission check?
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```


## Impact
The missing permission checks in `USSD.sol` expose the minting and burning functionality to unauthorized users. This vulnerability allows anyone to mint new USSD tokens or burn existing ones, leading to undesired changes in the token's supply and potentially compromising its trustworthiness and stability.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is crucial to implement proper permission checks in the mintRebalancer and burnRebalancer functions of USSD.sol. These checks should restrict access to authorized roles or accounts that are permitted to perform these actions.

Example of adding permission checks using the modifier

```solidity
    function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }

    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override onlyBalancer {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```
