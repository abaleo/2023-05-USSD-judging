# Lack of access control on crucial USSD minting and burning functionality

## Summary
The functions ```mintRebalancer``` and ```burnRebalancer``` which respectively mint and burn USSD tokens to manage the total supply have no access control and can be called by anybody.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function mintRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _mint(address(this), amount);
    }
```

## Impact
the crucial balancing functionality of the coin is compromised. This additionally affects the collateralFactor function due to its use of the totalSupply() function call.
