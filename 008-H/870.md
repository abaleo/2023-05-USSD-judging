# Lack of access control in mintRebalancer allows uncontrolled minting of USSD

## Summary
Function `mintRebalancer` has no access control, so anyone can increase the supply of `USSD` at will.

## Vulnerability Detail
`USSD` contract has a `onlyBalancer` modifier which is used only to guarantee that function `UniV3SwapInput` is called from the rebalancer, but should also be used in function `mintRebalancer`.

## Impact
High, minting of tokens without collateral should not be done permissionlessly.

## Tool used
Manual review.


## Recommendation
Use the `onlyBalancer` modifier in function `mintRebalancer`.
