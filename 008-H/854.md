# burnRebalancer does not have access control

## Summary
burnRebalancer does not have access control

## Vulnerability Detail
burnRebalancer does not have access control; anyone can mint arbitrary amount.

```solidity
    function burnRebalancer(uint256 amount) public override {
        _burn(address(this), amount);
    }
```

## Impact
the USSD address could be an arbitrary amount of USSD; confusing the totalSupply with the backed collateral
