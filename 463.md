# Wrong Collateral Index can be updated

## Summary
If `addCollateral()` is supplied with an `index` value such that `index < collateral.length` , this means that a particular index is to be edited.
function `swapCollateralIndexes()` is used to swap 2 indexes.
If  `addCollateral()` is called for a particular index(to edit it) and then later `swapCollateralIndexes()` is called for the same index to be swapped with another index but a Higher Gas is supplied, then  `swapCollateralIndexes()` will be executed and included in the block before  `addCollateral()` . Thus wrong values will be edited when  `addCollateral()` executes.


## Vulnerability Detail

Assume there are 4 collaterals.
If  `addCollateral()` is called with an index value (1). It means index 1 is to be edited with the provided information. After this,  `swapCollateralIndexes()` is run to swap index 1 with index 2, but this time a higher gas was provided. 
As a result `swapCollateralIndexes()` gets executed and included in the block before  `addCollateral()`.
Now when  `addCollateral()` is executed, index 1 is edited (but this time the values have been swapped - so actually the collateral which was at index 2 previously is updated since it was swapped with index 1)


## Impact

Wrong Collateral will be Edited and thus all the other functions will provide wrong results

```solidity
    function addCollateral(
        address _address,
        address _oracle,
        bool _mint,
        bool _redeem,
        uint256[] calldata _ratios,
        bytes memory _pathbuy,
        bytes memory _pathsell,
        uint256 index
    ) public onlyControl {
        CollateralInfo memory newCollateral = CollateralInfo({
            token: _address,
            mint: _mint,
            redeem: _redeem,
            oracle: IStableOracle(_oracle),
            pathbuy: _pathbuy,
            pathsell: _pathsell,
            ratios: _ratios
        });
        if (index < collateral.length) {
            collateral[index] = newCollateral; // for editing
        } else {
            collateral.push(newCollateral); // for adding new collateral
        }
    }
```

```solidity
    function swapCollateralIndexes(
        uint256 _index1,
        uint256 _index2
    ) public onlyControl {
        // cannot use (a, b) = (b, a) for storage variables
        CollateralInfo memory tmp = collateral[_index1];
        collateral[_index1] = collateral[_index2];
        collateral[_index2] = tmp;
    }

    function removeCollateral(uint256 _index) public onlyControl {
        collateral[_index] = collateral[collateral.length - 1];
        collateral.pop();
    }

    function getCollateralIndex(
        address _token
    ) public view returns (uint256 index) {
        for (index = 0; index < collateral.length; index++) {
            if (collateral[index].token == _token) {
                return index;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When `addCollateral()` is used to edit an index. It should be verified that the correct collateral is being updated.
Currently, only index is supplied and it is assumed that correct collateral will be updated - this is not the correct approach.
