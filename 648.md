# consider limiting the `allowance` given to the `uniRouter` and use `safeIncreaseAllowance` instead.

## Summary
The `USSD` contract approved the `uniRouter` contract unlimited amount of tokens for transfer and it uses the depreciated `approve()` instead of `safeIncreaseAllowance()`.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
            address(uniRouter),
            0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        );
    }
```
`0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` is a `hexadecimal` value representing a large number. In this context, it is used to set the token `allowance` to the maximum value allowed by the `ERC20` standard equated to `2^(256-1)`. By setting the allowance to this maximum value, it effectively approves the `uniRouter` contract to transfer any amount of the token on behalf of the `caller`.
However, granting unlimited token allowance also comes with potential risks. If the `router` contract is compromised or behaves `maliciously`, it could abuse the `unlimited allowance` to drain or misuse the tokens. Additionally, `unlimited allowance` removes the control over the maximum amount of tokens that can be transferred, potentially leading to unintended large transfers.

Meanwhile, the use of `approve()` has been depreciated for the use of `safeIncreaseAllowance()` & `safeDecreaseAllowance()` due to certain security reasons concerning `race conditions`. [See why here]()

## Impact
If any issue arises in the `uniRouter` contract an attacker can exploit the `USSD` contract because of this `unlimited allowance` and if measures are taken to decrease its allowance, it can be front-runned and back-runned to steal more funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the `safeIncreaseAllowance()` instead and do any of the following.
- `Limited Allowance`.
- `Time-Limited Allowance`.
- `Transaction Limits` ~ Implement transaction limits within the router contract to restrict the maximum amount of tokens that can be transferred in a single transaction.
- `Multi-Step Approval` Process Instead of granting immediate unlimited allowance, implement a multi-step approval process.
