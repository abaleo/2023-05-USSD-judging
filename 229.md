# `USSD::UniV3SwapInput()` executes swaps with no slippage protection

## Summary

`USSD::UniV3SwapInput()` executes swaps with no slippage protection. That will cause a loss of funds because of sandwich attacks when rebalancing the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

`UUSD::UniV3SwapInput()` does not set any value for `amountOutMinimum`. This means that an adversary can perform sandwich attacks against the protocol, as it accepts any amount of tokens.

`UniV3SwapInput()` is used by `USSDRebalancer::rebalance()`. So, the attack can be performed any time the swap is invoked.

```solidity
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0 // @audit
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```
