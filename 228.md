# Minting USDD tokens in exchange for DAI is impossible due to a broken oracle implementation

## Summary
The `getPriceUSD` function within the `StableOracleDAI.sol` contract consistently reverts because of an incorrect configuration for the `ethOracle` address. This issue arises from a hardcoded address, set to 0x00000..., in the constructor.

## Vulnerability Detail
To facilitate the provision of DAI tokens and the minting of USDD tokens, users can utilize the `mintForToken` function within the `USDD.sol` contract. This function relies on the `calculateMint` function to determine the DAI-USD price.

However, there is an issue with the implementation of the `getPriceUSD` function within the `StableOracleDAI.sol` contract which is used by the `calculateMint`. The `ethOracle` address parameter is incorrectly set to 0x0000..., with an accompanying unfinished TODO task regarding the "WETH oracle price".

As a result, when `getPriceUSD` attempts to invoke `ethOracle.getPriceUSD()`, the call fails because the ethOracle address is set to 0x00. Consequently, any transaction involving this function will consistently revert.

## Impact
The contract's functionality is currently broken, preventing anyone from successfully minting USDD tokens in exchange for DAI. This issue arises due to transactions consistently reverting, making the minting process impossible.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Complete the implementation of the `StableOracleDAI.sol` contract correctly. This entails ensuring the inclusion of comprehensive test cases that cover all possible scenarios. Additionally, it is crucial to utilize actual oracle contracts instead of relying on the `SimOracle.sol`. By conducting thorough testing, this vulnerability could have been identified and addressed.
