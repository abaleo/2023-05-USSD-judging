# burnRebalancer() can be called by anyone due to lack of access control in USSD.sol

## Summary

burnRebalancer() can be called by anyone due to lack of access control

## Vulnerability Detail

Although rebalance() function is public and it's said in documentation, inside of it there is a call to burnRebalancer() that should be done only under certain conditions that is: else if (ownval < 1e6 + threshold). It means if the value of USSD is too low then the protocol buys sells collateral and burns USSD tokens to increase the value (according to the specification).

## Impact

Any amount of USSD can be created by anybody due to lack of access control and public visibility of the burnRebalancer()
