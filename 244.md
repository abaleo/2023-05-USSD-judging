# All calls to `StableOracleDAI.getPriceUSD()` will revert

## Summary

All calls to the `getPriceUSD` function in `StableOracleDAI` will revert as it tries to make a function call located at the zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail

The constructor in `StableOracleDAI` sets the `ethOracle` storage variable to the zero address. 

```solidity
    constructor() {
        priceFeedDAIETH = AggregatorV3Interface(0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4);

        DAIEthOracle = IStaticOracle(0x982152A6C7f732Ec7C9EA998dDD9Ebde00Dfa16e);
        ethOracle = IStableOracle(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000); // TODO: WETH oracle price
    }
```

As part of the `getPriceUSD` function, the `ethOracle` variable is used to make a function call. Since the `ethOracle` variable is set to the zero address, the function call will revert.

```solidity
    uint256 wethPriceUSD = ethOracle.getPriceUSD();
```

## Impact

This makes the `StableOracleDAI` unusable as it will always revert when trying to get the price of DAI. This results in the rebalancer being unable to perform any rebalancing actions and the USSD token will not be able to be used as a stablecoin.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set the `ethOracle` variable to the address of the WETH oracle instead of the zero address.
