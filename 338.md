# USSD can be minted and burned freely.

## Summary

The `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` functions lack the `onlyBalancer` modifier.

## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can mint and burn USSD tokens to the USSD contract without providing or reedeming collateral since the functions `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` can be called by anyone.

## Impact

Incrementing the supply of USSD directly impacts the function `collateralFactor()` at the `USSD.sol` contract. This function and the supply are sensitive values on the `USSDRebalancer.sol` contract which purpose is to rebalance (by expanding or reducing) the circulation of USSD to maintain the peg of the token.

By incrementing the supply of USSD without adding collateral will make the `USSDRebalancer.sol` to think that the token has lost its peg and hence trigger a peg-down recovery when it should not, breaking the algorithmic economic-mechanics of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add to both functions `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer` the `onlyBalancer` modifier.
