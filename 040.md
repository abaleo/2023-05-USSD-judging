# Rebalancing is open to flashloan attack

## Summary
Rebalancing begins by fetching USSD's spot price relative to DAI from its Uniswap pool. Anyone can imbalance the pool through a flash loan before rebalancing begins which leads to a wrong USSD price. This results in incorrect rebalancing, even more so because of the fact that `rebalance()` function can be called by anyone.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`rebalance()`](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L93) calls [`getOwnValuation()`](https://github.com/USSDofficial/ussd-contracts/blob/f44c726371f3152634bcf0a3e630802e39dec49c/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L71) to determine USSD price relative to DAI:
```solidity
function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
  (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
  if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
    price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
  } else {
    price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
    // flip the fraction
    price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
  }
}
```
`uniPool.slot()` returns the spot price's square root which is susceptible to flash loan attack as explained above.


## Impact
High. Almost all rebalancing transactions will result in loss for the protocol.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function getOwnValuation() public view returns (uint256 price) {
  (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) =  uniPool.slot0();
  if(uniPool.token0() == USSD) {
    price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))/(1e6) >> (96 * 2);
  } else {
    price = uint(sqrtPriceX96)*(uint(sqrtPriceX96))*(1e18 /* 1e12 + 1e6 decimal representation */) >> (96 * 2);
    // flip the fraction
    price = (1e24 / price) / 1e12;
  }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a TWAP price which will result in inaccurate price (due to being an average over time) but more resistant towards price manipulation.
