# A collateral Can Be Linked With Any Oracle Which Leads To Incorrect USSD Mint

## Summary

There is no check in the function `addCollateral` in the USSD contract if the oracle that is being associated with the collateral belongs 
to the collateral . 

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no check in the function `addCollateral` in the USSD contract if the oracle that is being associated with the collateral belongs 
to the collateral . 
Here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L85 suppose the controller (maliciously or mistakenly) provides a token X as collateral  , and as the oracle here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L86 provides StableOracleWBGL (it's the most volatile). 
Therefore , when we call `mintForToken` which calls `calculateMint` on the token,  it would use the price returned by the incorrect oracle , and the USSD mints calculated would be different(can be a huge margin depending on the oracle used) , which will break the peg of USSD. It will also hinder with collateralFactor()  , which would be calculated incorrectly.

## Impact

Therefore , when we call `mintForToken` which calls `calculateMint` on a token,  it would use the price returned by the incorrect oracle , 
and the USSD mints calculated would be different(can be a huge margin depending on the oracle used) , which will break the peg
of USSD. It will also hinder with collateralFactor()  , which would be calculated incorrectly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Verify all the inputs for the collateral , or assign the collaterals (as per docs , DAI, WETH  ,WBTC , WBGL) in the constructor itself.
