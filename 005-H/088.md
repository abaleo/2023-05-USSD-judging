# getPriceUSD() in StableOracleDAI.sol does not calculate DAI price in terms of USD properly

## Summary

The price of DAI in terms of USD is not calculated properly.

## Vulnerability Detail

This is the current calculation of DAI in terms of USD. Note that the return value has to be in 18 decimal places in order to integrate well with other contracts in the protocol.

```solidity
        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
    }
```

The pricing formula comprises 3 types of price. wethPriceUSD, DAIWethPrice and the price variable from priceFeedDAIETH. 

1. `wethPriceUSD` is derived from ethOracle price, presumably the ETH/USD Chainlink oracle, and returns the ETH price in USD.
2. `DAIWethPrice` is derived from the on-chain Uniswap oracle, and calculates the WETH price in terms of DAI.
3. `price` is derived from priceFeedDAIETH oracle, which is the DAI/ETH Chainlink oracle, 

```solidity
        uint256 wethPriceUSD = ethOracle.getPriceUSD();
        uint256 DAIWethPrice = DAIEthOracle.quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
```
Assuming all integrations work well, this is how the calculation will go:

(wethPriceUSD * 1e18) / ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);

`wethPriceUSD `= 181759000000 (8 decimal places)
`DAIWethPrice` = 1817331962824889681175 (18 decimal places)
`price` = 551720649183640 ( 18 decimal places)


(181759000000 * 1e18) / ((1817331962824889681175 + 551720649183640 * 1e10) / 2) = 65866.3581832, which is not the correct DAI/USD price.


Here is why it is different: 
1. `price` is returned in 18 decimals already. There is no need to scale by another 1e10
2. `price` returns DAI price in ETH, means it returns 0.0005517206, and not ETH price in DAI. The intention of adding `DAIWethPrice` and `price` and then dividing by 2 is to get the average of ETH price in terms of DAI using an onChain oracle (uniswap) and an off chain oracle (chainlink). However, `DAIWethPrice` returns ETH price in DAI (1 ETH is worth 1817 DAI), and `price` returns DAI price in ETH (1 DAI is worth 0.00055 ETH), so the addition does not make sense.

(Calculation will differ due to fluctuation in prices)
## Impact

Wrong pricing of DAI will break protocol especially since DAI is integral to the protocol. (rebalance, collateral etc.)

## Recommendation

Recommend using the DAI/USD chainlink oracle for simplicity: 0xaed0c38402a5d19df6e4c03f4e2dced6e29c1ee9.

If intent is to calculate DAI-ETH and then ETH-USD, make sure that the decimal calculations are correct. wethPriceUSD returns 8 decimals so have to scale up by 10. Afterwards, scale by 1e18 since other contracts in the protocol assumes oracle returns decimals in 1e18 format.

((wethPriceUSD * 1e10) / DAIWethPrice) * 1e18
((181759000000 * 1e10) / (1817331962824889681175) ) * 1e18 = 1.000142e+18

1 DAI = 1.000142e18 USD
