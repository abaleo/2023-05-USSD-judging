# `getPriceUSD` in `StableOracleDai` is miscalculated with wrong decimals from the `priceFeedDAIETH` Chainlink feed

## Summary

The used DAI/ETH feed has 18 decimals, but it is treated as it returned 8 decimals in the code.

This leads to a bad price calculation that affects the amount of USSD tokens minted for the users in `USSD::mintForToken()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `priceFeedDAIETH` in the `StableOracleDai` has 18 decimals as can be checked on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4#readContract).

The code is misleading as it confusing the actual pair used in the comment. The pair actually corresponds to DAI/ETH:

> chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD, so multiply by 10 decimals to get 18 decimal fractional

But the actual problem is that the code indeed performs the unnecessary scaling in `uint256(price) * 1e10`.

```solidity
// constructor()
24:        priceFeedDAIETH = AggregatorV3Interface(
25:            0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4
26:        );

// getPrice()
46:    // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD, so multiply by 10 decimals to get 18 decimal fractional
47:    //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
48:    (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
49:
50:    return
51:        (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
52:        ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```

This leads to a higher average price for the calculated pair, and as it is the divisor of the calculation, the result for `getPrice()` will be lower.

A lower than expected result in `getPrice()` will lead to less tokens minted for users calling `USSD::mintForToken`.

Also worth mentioning that `USSDRebalancer::rebalance()` also relies on the result of this price calculation and will make it perform trades with incorrect values.

## Impact

Users will receive far less USSD tokens than they should when they call `mintForToken()`, making them lose assets.

When performed the `USSDRebalancer::rebalance()`, all the calculations will be broken for the DAI oracle, leading to incorrect pool trades due to the error in `getPrice()`

## Recommendation

Do not scale the `priceFeedDAIETH` coming from the DAI/ETH Chainlink feed.
