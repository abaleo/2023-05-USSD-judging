# Poor validation of the price allows negative price or zero price to be used

## Summary

Poor validation of the price allows negative price or zero price to be used

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD, so multiply by 10 decimals to get 18 decimal fractional
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeedDAIETH.latestRoundData();

        return
            (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
            ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
```

note that the chainlink price returned is int256, but if the chainlink price is negative or zero, the price is slienlty cast to uint256 and still be used to value to token worth.

## Impact

invalid price is used, espeically when price goes to negative and the sliently casting to uint256, the collateral valuation will be wrong and the USSD is minted in a wrong rate

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol make sure revert the transaction if the chainlink price is <= to 0

I think it is fair to refer to this finding :) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/177
