# Wrong calculation of decimals in `StableOracleDAI` contract

## Summary
The calculation logic of the `StableOracleDAI::getPriceUSD` works with the value returned by the Chainlink dai/eth price feed as if it was a value with 8 decimals. However, it actually has 18 decimals, which makes the calculated price 1e10 times larger. 


## Vulnerability Detail

Currently, the logic of the `StableOracleDAI::getPriceUSD` function assumes that the price returned by the dai/eth Chainlink price feed has 8 decimal places. However, as mentioned above, it actually has 18. This can be seen here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x773616e4d11a78f511299002da57a0a94577f1f4#readContract#F3


## Impact

The `StableOracleDAI::getPriceUSD` function will return 1e10 bigger price than the actual one, in turn, making all of the calculation logic that depends on this value wrong.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make the following change:

```diff
return
     (wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /
-    ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);
+    ((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price)) / 2);
```
