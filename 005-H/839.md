# Incorrect decimals used in the `getPriceUSD` function which uses Chainlink oracle to fetch real time price.

## Summary
We need to take into account the decimals of each collateral token when price is returned from the function.

WETH: 18
WBTC: 8
DAI: 18
WBGL: 18

and then fix the price returned from function. 

## Vulnerability Detail

For the decimals part, the WBTC has 8 decimals, so the below code would lead to loss of funds if not verified before deployment

Code to fetch WETH price -
```solidity
function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        //!! Verify latestRoundData, stale data.
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD
        return uint256(price) * 1e10;
    }
```

Code to fetch WBTC price -
```solidity
function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {
        //(uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        //!! Verify latestRoundData, stale data.
        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WETH/USD
        return uint256(price) * 1e10;
    }
```

In above case, the returned price seem to be multiplied by `1e10` in both cases even when their token decimals differ. Much care and verification needs to be taken for each added collateral token to avoid loss of funds.

## Impact

1. Loss of funds.
2. Unexpected/Irregular fund transfer.
3. Incorrect amount collected as collateral. If the amount is lower than required, user funds could be liquidated even when the threshold is correctly maintained by user / bots.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider multiplying the returned value by 1^8 for WBTC, and 1^18 for DAI, WETH, WBGL. Make sure the decimal is checked and used for each newly added collateral token.
