# `StableOracleDAI.sol` assumes the wrong decimals in the `getPriceUSD` function

## Summary
`StableOracleDAI.sol` assumes the wrong decimals in the `getPriceUSD` function which would not give a 1e18 based number as it is pressumed.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `getPriceUSD` calculate `DAIWethPrice` which is a 1e18 based number, `wethPriceUSD` which is another 1e18 based number and it also the the `latestRoundData` from the `priceFeedDAIETH` address https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L33-L48
In the end it return the calculation of the price which looks like this https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleDAI.sol#L50-L53 the function assumes that the `price` variable it is an 1e8 based number, but in reality if you check the address `0x773616E4d11A78F511299002da57A0a94577F1f4` where the DAI/ETH price feed is, the decimals of the price is 18 and not 8

which would mess up the calculation of the price, giving you a 1e8 based number.
## Impact
This would be a high severity since it will mess up the price calculation of the most important collateral used by the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't multiply the price with 1e10 to get a 1e18 number since the price it is a already a 1e18 based number
