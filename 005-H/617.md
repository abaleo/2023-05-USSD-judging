# Incorrect Decimal Setting in StableOracleDAI Contract for DAI/ETH Price Retrieval

## Summary
The StableOracleDAI contract contains a vulnerability due to an incorrect decimal setting when retrieving the DAI/ETH price. This misconfiguration leads to the retrieval of an incorrect DAI price. According to the information provided in [https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/92513](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/92513), non-ETH pairs have a decimal value of 8, while ETH pairs have a decimal value of 18. However, the code assumes a decimal value of 8 for the DAI/ETH price retrieval, resulting in a significant overestimation of the price. This undervalues the worth of DAI throughout the contract, preventing users from utilizing the protocol effectively.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect assumption of the decimal value when retrieving the DAI/ETH price in the StableOracleDAI contract. As the price retrieval is for an ETH pair, the decimal value should be set to 18. However, the code incorrectly assumes a decimal value of 8. Consequently, during the calculation `(wethPriceUSD * 1e18) /((DAIWethPrice + uint256(price) * 1e10) / 2);`, the term price * 1e10 becomes an extremely large value, resulting in a severe undervaluation of DAI. Since the value of DAI is used throughout the contract, users are unable to utilize the protocol properly due to the incorrect evaluation of DAI's worth.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it affects the accurate evaluation of DAI's price and consequently impairs the usability of the protocol. By undervaluing DAI, users may encounter various issues when interacting with the protocol, including inaccurate collateral calculations, incorrect rebalancing decisions, and distorted pricing mechanisms. This can lead to financial losses, imbalanced portfolios, and a loss of trust in the protocol's reliability.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is crucial to correct the decimal setting for the DAI/ETH price retrieval in the StableOracleDAI contract. The code should be updated to reflect the correct decimal value of 18 for ETH pairs, ensuring accurate price calculations and evaluation of DAI's worth.
