# Incorrect Aggregator Set for WBTC Price in StableOracleWBTC.sol



## Summary

The contract `StableOracleWBTC` contains a bug where the aggregator interface is set incorrectly for retrieving the WBTC/USD price. The wrong aggregator address is used, resulting in incorrect prices being returned by the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `StableOracleWBTC` contract, the `priceFeed` aggregator interface is initialized with an incorrect address in the constructor:
[StableOracleWBTC.sol#contructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L15C1-L19)

```solidity
    constructor() {
//@audit the below is the pricefeed for the ETH/USD and BTC/USD
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419
        );
    }
```

The address `0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419` corresponds to the Chainlink ETH/USD price feed, not the BTC/USD price feed. As a result, when the `getPriceUSD()` function retrieves the latest price using `priceFeed.latestRoundData()`, it incorrectly retrieves the ETH/USD price instead of the expected WBTC/USD price.

NB: This seems to be probably a copy paste error as just a few lines above the contract you can see that the correct pricefeed address for BTC/USD is commented out

```solidity
/*
    wbtc 0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599;
    chainlink btc/usd priceFeed 0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c;
*/
```

## Impact

The bug impacts the accuracy of price calculations in the `StableOracleWBTC` contract. By setting the wrong aggregator address, the contract fetches incorrect prices, which can lead to erroneous calculations and inaccurate WBTC/USD conversion rates. This issue undermines the reliability and functionality of the contract, potentially affecting any operations or applications relying on accurate WBTC price data.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, it is recommended to update the `priceFeed` aggregator address with the correct address of the BTC/USD price feed. The accurate address for the BTC/USD price feed should be `0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c`. By setting the correct aggregator address, the `getPriceUSD()` function will retrieve the WBTC/USD price accurately, ensuring correct price calculations in the contract.
