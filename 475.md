# Result of the calculation is zero when collateral token has precision of 8 decimals

## Summary
The problem arises when performing calculations in the BuyUSSDSellCollateral function, specifically when calculating the amountToSellUnits value. If the collateral token has a precision of 8 decimals, there is a possibility of obtaining a result of zero under certain conditions.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` function is used within the protocol to buy USSD tokens by selling collateral assets. Inside the function , there is a line of code that calculates amountToSellUnits based on the balance of the collateral token in the USSD contract and the ratio of amountToBuyLeftUSD to the collateral valuation. However, there is a potential problem when the collateral token has a precision of 8 decimals, such as WBTC.
```solidity
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateral.length; i++) {
        uint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;
        if (collateralval > amountToBuyLeftUSD) {
          // sell a portion of collateral and exit
          if (collateral[i].pathsell.length > 0) {
            uint256 amountBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
            uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, amountToSellUnits);
            amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
            DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
          }
```
In the given scenario, where the collateral token is WBTC and IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) is equal to 1e8, amountToBuyLeftUSD is 1000 * 1e18, and collateralval is 28000 * 1e18, the calculation 1e8 * (1000 * 1e18 * 1e18 / 28000 * 1e18) / 1e18) / 1e18 results in zero.

## Impact
This can lead to undesirable consequences when executing the subsequent Uniswap V3 swap, as the intended amount to sell could end up being zero, potentially disrupting the desired rebalancing mechanism of the protocol.
