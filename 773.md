# Any ERC20 Can Be Provided As Collateral

## Summary

The Docs mention The allowed collaterals are DAI , WETH , WBTC , WBGL, but in the function addCollateral there is no restriction
on which asset will be added as collateral. Consider when pool is initialized , and instead of making DAI as the first collateral(as it is supposed to be the least volatile) , the controller (maliciously or mistakenly) makes a volatile asset as the first collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

In this function here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L84  , a controller can add collaterals , but there is no restriction on which asset should be a 
valid collateral asset. If provided an asset which is more volatile than the queue should be (refer the docs where it says The goal of having an order of collateral liquidation is to have more volatile
assets be further in the queue, allowing them to be accumulated and grow in
value, while keeping DAI as near-line reserves and serve as a protection buffer
from speculative manipulation.) , it might break the peg or make the USSD more volatile.

## Impact

If provided an asset which is more volatile than the queue should be  , it might break the peg or make the USSD more volatile.

## Recommendation

Have checks where first collateral in the array should be DAI then WETH and so on and have restrictions on which ERC20 to assign as collateral
