# USSD price will depeg

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The WhitePaper specifies that `1000 USSD` are initially minted to setUp the USSD/DAI pool: 

> USSD coin is ’initialized’ with one-time minting of 1000 USSD, taking 1000
DAI as collateral. This 1000 USSD would allow to create a pool USSD/DAI to
have initial liquidity. 

However, during the initialization of the USSD contract `10,000 USSD` are minted:
```solidity
   function initialize(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol
    ) public initializer {
        __Context_init_unchained();
        __AccessControl_init_unchained();
        __ERC20_init_unchained(name, symbol);

        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _msgSender());

        // mint 10k USSD to create initial pool
        _mint(msg.sender, 10_000 * 1e6);
    }
``` 

## Impact
SInce the intention is for USSD to be backed by DAI, supplying 10,000 USSD for 1000 DAI will make the price of DAI 10x more than USSD. Therefore, USSD will not be pegged to DAI

## Recommendation
Mint 1000 USSD as indicated in the whitepaper or ensure to supply 10,000 DAI
