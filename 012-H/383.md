# Wrong calculations in assets leads to DoS

## Summary
The function [`BuyUSSDSellCollateral()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L132-L137) has an option if the collateral is under the needed amount `collateralval`, but above 5% of it  `amountToBuyLeftUSD / 20`, for it to sell 100% of this type of collateral and move to the next one. In the calculation for that there is an underflow error.
## Vulnerability Detail
**Note**: sponsor confined that `baseAsset == DAI` and `collateralval[0] == DAI`
The `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` function includes an option to sell 100% of a particular type of collateral and move to the next one if the collateral is below the required amount `collateralval < amountToBuyLeftUSD`, but still above 5% of it
 `collateralval >= amountToBuyLeftUSD / 20`.

However, there seems to be an issue with the calculation in this function. The code first retrieves the entire collateral balance of the USSD contract and then performs a swap using `UniV3SwapInput()`. After the swap, there is a calculation that subtracts the previous balance from the current balance to update `amountToBuyLeftUSD`:
```jsx
amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
```
Since it previously sold 100% of the balance `IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD)` should return 0 and the calculation should be :

```jsx
amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (0 - amountBefore);
```
Witch will cause underflow and revert the function.

## Impact
If `collateralval < amountToBuyLeftUSD` && `collateralval >= amountToBuyLeftUSD / 20` the `rebalance()`will fail when it tries to call `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()`.
## Code Snippet
```jsx
if (collateralval >= amountToBuyLeftUSD / 20) {
    uint256 amountBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
    //here we sell 100%
    IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD));
    //@audit after this trade up, shouldn't IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) == 0 ?
    amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore); 
    DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```jsx
   -       amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
   -       DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
            
   +       amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (amountBefore - IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD));
   +       DAItosell += (amountBefore - IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD));
   ```
