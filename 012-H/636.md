# Denial of service for `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` when the collateral value for DAI is less than `amountToBuyLeftUSD`

## Summary

Whenever the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function is called, if the collateral value for DAI is less than `amountToBuyLeftUSD`, and the function is attempting to sell DAI in exchange for USSD, the function call will always revert

## Vulnerability Detail

The USSDRebalancer contract has the function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` which is used to support the price of USSD in the USSD/DAI Uniswap pool. It loops through all available collateral and calculates whether there is enough of that collateral to sell and acquire a specified amount of DAI which will later be used to swap into the USSD/DAI pool. The function has different logic to support when there is enough collateral to buy the entire amount of required DAI, and when there isn't:
```solidity
if (collateralval > amountToBuyLeftUSD) {
  // sell a portion of collateral and exit
  if (collateral[i].pathsell.length > 0) {
    uint256 amountBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
    uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
    IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, amountToSellUnits);
    amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
    DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
  } else {
    // no need to swap DAI
    DAItosell = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * amountToBuyLeftUSD / collateralval;
  }
  break;
} else {
  // sell all or skip (if collateral is too little, 5% treshold)
  if (collateralval >= amountToBuyLeftUSD / 20) {
    uint256 amountBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
    // sell all collateral and move to next one
    IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD));
    amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
    DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
  }
}
```
Notice that when `(collateralval > amountToBuyLeftUSD)`, there is additional logic that checks if `(collateral[i].pathsell.length > 0)`. This is necessary because the DAI collateral does not have a set `pathsell` (it is empty bytes). 

The issue is when there is less DAI than `amountToBuyLeftUSD` and `(collateralval >= amountToBuyLeftUSD / 20)`, where the collateral type is DAI. In this case, there is no logic to support the fact that there is no `pathsell`, meaning the call to `UniV3SwapInput` will result in the function call reverting. It will continue to revert until the amount of DAI is greater than `amountToBuyLeftUSD`. This will also likely happen early on, as the whitepaper specifies that DAI will be the first collateral to be sold down to ~0.

## Impact

Based on the relative difference between the collateral value for DAI in the USSD contract and the `amountToBuyLeftUSD`, it will be impossible to call the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function, resulting in the inability of the protocol to rebalance the DAI/USSD pool when USSD has dropped in value

## Recommendation

In the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` function, when the collateral value for DAI is less than `amountToBuyLeftUSD` but there is still enough DAI to pass the 5% threshold, there should be logic to check if the current collateral is DAI (e.g. `(collateral[i].pathsell.length == 0)`). If it is DAI, rather than swapping using Uniswap, simply add the balance of DAI in the USSD contract to the `DAItosell` variable.
