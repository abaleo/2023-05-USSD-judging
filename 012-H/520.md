# Incorrect accounting on the variable amountToBuyLeftUSD

## Summary

Priority order of collateral to be sold is broken due to a lack of update on the `amountToBuyLeftUSD` variable.

## Vulnerability Detail

During a re-balancing in a peg-down recovery event, the function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` is used to sell collateral for DAI, then use this DAI to buy USSD from the DAI / USSD Uniswap pool, and the burn the USSD bought.

To achieve this, collateral is sold given a priority order and a variable `amountToBuyLeftUSD` is used to track how much is left to buy. This can bee [seen](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L119-L128) in the code:

```solidity
if (collateral[i].pathsell.length > 0) {
   uint256 amountBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
   uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
   IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, amountToSellUnits);
   amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
   DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
} 
else {
   // no need to swap DAI
   DAItosell = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * amountToBuyLeftUSD / collateralval;
}
```

The case when the collateral is DAI (the else branch above) where no swap happens, the `amountToBuyLeftUSD` variable is not updated. 

## Impact

This will cause that collateral which is further on the priority order to get sold when it should not, breaking the assumption that DAI is a protection for the others more speculative collaterals. Quoting the whitepaper (section 5 paragraphs 4 and 5):

```solidity
/*
The collateral has selling priority (order), which is: 1. DAI, 2. WETH, 3. WBTC, 4. WBGL.
The goal of having an order of collateral liquidation is to have more volatile assets be further in the queue, allowing them to be accumulated and grow in value, while keeping DAI as near-line reserves and serve as a protection buffer from speculative manipulation.
*/
```

## Recommendation

Update the `amountToBuyLeftUSD` on the else branch
