# The threshold applied when the collateral is too little will prevent from withdrawing a portion of each collateral eventually

## Summary
In `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` when the collateral is too little the 5% threshold will prevent from withdrawing a portion of each collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the event of a DAI depeg, almost all the collateral could be used to try to rebalance the USSD / DAI pool. Up untill all collateral value reach the threshold of 5% of the value needed to rebalance:

[USSDRebalancer.sol#L130-L138](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L130-L138)
```solidity
        } else {
          // sell all or skip (if collateral is too little, 5% treshold)
          if (collateralval >= amountToBuyLeftUSD / 20) {
            uint256 amountBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD);
            // sell all collateral and move to next one
            IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD));
            amountToBuyLeftUSD -= (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
            DAItosell += (IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore);
          }
```
Theses leftover tokens will never be claimable against USSD (since there is no redeem function).


## Impact
In case of a DAI depeg, a portion of the collateral tokens could be stuck in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a function that allows to take out collateral out of the contract in case of emergency.
