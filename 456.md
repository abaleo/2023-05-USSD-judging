# Lack of slippage control can affect the overcollateralization

## Summary

Whenever called the `rebalance()` function in `USSDRebalancer.sol` checks the current valuation of the USSD coin and based on given lower and higher bound threshold rebalances the USSD price on the USSD/DAI UniswapV3 pool. In order to do that the contract either sells collateral (WETH, WBGL, WBTC) for DAI and buys USSD from the pool or sells USSD to the USSD/DAI UniswapV3 pool and uses portion of the DAI to buy other collaterals via Uniswap - WETH, WBTC, WBTC.

The forementioned swaps call the `UniV3SwapInput()` function in the `USSD.sol` contract which internally calles the UniswapV3Router `exactInput()` with the specified parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail

The following parameters are passed to the `exactInput()` function call:

```solidity
IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
```

As we can see the `amountOutMinimum` is hardcoded to `0`, which means that any received amount from any of the swaps mentioned above is valid. This exposes the protocol to sandwich attacks. 

## Impact

A potential sandwich attack during `rebalancing` could cause a significant loss to the protocol as well as impact the `overcollateralization` of the USSD stable coin as less collateral will be received and stored.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set `amountOutMinimum` to a reasonable amount expected based on the system requirements. Since the `rebalance()` function can be called by anyone it is not advisable to allow users to pass `amountOutMinimum` as parameter as this could be easily exploited by an attacker that wants to execute a sandwich attack and it would only affect the protocol. 

Calculate the `amountOutMinimum` within the `rebalance` function and pass it as parameter to the `UniV3SwapInput` invocation. 

Since all swaps move `from` or `to` DAI, when swapping other type of collateral to DAI or swapping DAI for other type of collateral, the `amountOutMinimum` can be calculated using the amount that will be sold/bought and the price in USD of that amount with added 0.5-1% safe margin.

Simple example:

Code that executes a sell of collateral to DAI:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L119-L124

Calculation of `amountOutMinimum` to be passed as slippage parameter:

```solidity
uint256 collateralToSellValue = amountToSellUnits * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD();
uint256 safeMargin = collateralToSellValue * 1e16; // 1% safe margin
uint256 amountOutMinimum = collateralToSellValue  - safeMargin; 
```

In sell cases you can compute (WBTC,WETH,WBGL --> DAI) `amountOutMinimum` by doing: 

`x * p - ((x * p) * s)` 

where `x` is the amount of collateral to swap, `p` is the current USD value of that collateral and `s` is a safe margin.

In buy cases you can compute (DAI --> WBTC,WETH,WBGL) `amountOutMinimum` by doing:

`x / p - ((x / p) * s)`
