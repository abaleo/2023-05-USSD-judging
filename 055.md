# Improper decimals handling in StableOracleDAI.sol

## Summary

In StableOracleDAI.sol, the DAI/ETH price feed has 18 decimals but, instead, the contract makes all the calculations like it has 8 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

Unlike BTC/USD or ETH/USD price feeds, all the ETH price feeds (DAI/ETH included) have 18 decimals instead of 8. Therefore, there is no need to multiply price by 1e10 like it's done in the contract.

## Impact

High-risk vulnerability. Incorrect prices for getPriceUSD() will be received due to incorrect calculations for DAI/ETH price feed.

## Code Snippet

uint256(price) * 1e10 :

Also, you can see the number of decimals for DAI/ETH price feed by reading the contract's variable on etherscan:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove multiplication by 1e10.
