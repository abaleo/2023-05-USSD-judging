# `WBGL/ETH` pool liquidity is too low

## Summary

`WBGL/ETH` pool liquidity is too low.

## Vulnerability Detail

At the moment of the writing the Uniswap V3 pool fof `WBGL/ETH` has only $11,060 of liquidity. This makes the use of this pool as a price oracle discouraged, as it can be easily manipulated, even if the TWAP is used.

## Impact

The price of WBGL can be manipulated having the following consequences:

- When using WBGL to mint USSD, an incorrect amount will be minted.
- The rebalance functionality will not work as expected, as the amounts to be swapped in `USSDRebalancer.sol:SellUSSDBuyCollateral()` and `USSDRebalancer.sol:BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` will be incorrect.

## Recommendation
