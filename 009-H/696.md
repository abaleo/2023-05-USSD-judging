# TWAP intervals should be flexible as per market conditions (likely oracle manipulation attack against `WETH/WBGL` pool)

## Summary
The protocol is using the same TWAP interval (600 seconds) for both `WETH/WBGL` and `WETH/DAI` token pools while their liquidity and activity is very different.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol is using the same TWAP interval (600 seconds) for both `WETH/WBGL` and `WETH/DAI` token pools while their liquidity and activity is very different - the former has liquidity of $22.7k compared to $15.62M which is many multiple orders of magnitude difference. Instead, appropriate and distinct values should be used for both pools to mitigate against potential oracle manipulation attacks.

## Impact
Due to low liquidity, pricing of the `WETH/WBGL` pool is likely easily manipulatable over multiple blocks. Due to the nature of TWAPs, a single outlier price point can lead to wildly skewed price data over a given range, especially when as short as 10 minutes) which will very likely result in a price oracle manipulation attack against the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The TWAP interval value should not be constant but rather changeable by the controller since it is dependent upon market conditions and activity (e.g 1-hour TWAP might lag considerably in sudden movements but 10-minute TWAP may be susceptible to manipulation). Considerations will depend on both
the pool and market activity, such that it is not advised to have the same interval for both `WETH/WBGL` and `WETH/DAI` pools.
