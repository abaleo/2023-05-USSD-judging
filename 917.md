# Manipulate the token balance to disable the rebalancing function.

## Summary
Within the rebalancing function, there is a process to subtract the token balance between DAI and USSD.
By sending the tokens out of balance, it is always possible to make the execution fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the rebalancing function, depending on the case, there are two processes: `USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12` and `DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount`.
When the condition is such that the former is likely to be executed, it front-runs and sends a DAI token to make `USSDamount < DAIamount`. Then the execution of this function will fail.
When the latter is the case, the USSD is sent.
This will prevent the execution of this function which is extremely important for the specification.
## Impact
Disabling the rebalancing function

## Recommendation
The case is divided subject to the token balance.
