# DoS on the BuyUSSDSellCollateral when the amountToBuyLeftUSD variable is zero

## Summary

Due not handling the case where the `amountToBuyLeftUSD` variable is zero, the function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

During a re-balancing in a peg-down recovery event, the function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` is used to sell collateral for DAI, then use this DAI to buy USSD from the DAI / USSD Uniswap pool, and the burn the USSD bought. To achieve this, collateral is sold given a priority order and a variable `amountToBuyLeftUSD` is used to track how much is left to buy.

The priority order is used to protect some types of collateral to not be sold, unless the previous collaterals could not absorbed the amount of USD to be bought, so its expected that the variable `amountToBuyLeftUSD` to be zero at some point. The problem happens in the following two lines:

```solidity
uint256 amountToSellUnits = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * ((amountToBuyLeftUSD * 1e18 / collateralval) / 1e18) / 1e18;
IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathsell, amountToSellUnits);
```

Because `amountToBuyLeftUSD` is zero, then `amountToSellUnits` will be zero too, and the contract will try to swap 0 tokens of the current collateral of the loop. Looking at the UniswapV3 contracts, I realized the transaction will revert since the pools do not accept zero amounts of tokens to swap ([see the code here](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L603)):

```solidity
function swap(
        address recipient,
        bool zeroForOne,
        int256 amountSpecified,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override noDelegateCall returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) {
        require(amountSpecified != 0, 'AS');
```

## Impact

Potentially DoS on the `BuyUSSDSellCollateral()` function which is crucial during peg-down recovery events

## Recommendation

At the beginning of the for loop check that `amountToBuyLeftUSD` is not zero, if it is zero then break the loop.
