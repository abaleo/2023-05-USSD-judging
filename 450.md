# Missing slippage check in uniswap swaps

## Summary

USSD.sol:`UniV3SwapInput` has no slippage control.

## Vulnerability Detail

Frontrunning and sandwich attacks are extremely common on the blockchain and the best way to protect one self is by using slippage checks. This contract however fails to implement any slippage checks, allowing sandwich attackers and frontrunners to drain the contract dry whenever using the `rebalance` mechanism.

When the `rebalance` function is called, if USSd is below peg, it will sell the collateral assets to raise DAI, and then use that DAI to raise the price of USSD. The collateral selling is done in the function `BuyUSSDSellCollateral`.

Each collateral has a sell path associated with it, which is used by the USSD contract to carry out the swap via uniswapV3. The rebalancer calls the function `UniV3SwapInput` with the sell path and amount to actually carry out the swap. However this function, implemented in USSD.sol, has no slippage checks.

`amountOutMinimum` is set to 0, allowing any amount of slippage. Thus attackers can manipulate the uniswap pools, call `rebalance`, and then rebalance the uniswap pools in a typical sandwich attack to profit off the rebalancer. Unlike typical sandwich attacks, attackers can do all this in a single transaction, making this attack even easier to perform.

Steps to recreate the attack:

1. Either start with an out of tolerance price, or manipulate the price so that `rebalance` can be called.
2. Skew the prices in the collateral token pools. The contract uses WETH, WBTC, WBGL so manipulate the prices of the tokens with respect to DAI.
3. Call `rebalance` to sell the collateral tokens for DAI.
4. Rebalance the maniopulated pools back to their original prices and make a profit.

The profit depends on the amount of collateral sold, which depends on the amount of depeg.

## Impact

Sandwich attackers can drain the contract by arbitraging `rebalance` calls.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The oracle prices are already available to the rebalancer. Set the `minimumAmountOut` to a value that is a function of the oracle price of the collateral token, so that only a limited amount of slippage can be tolerated.
