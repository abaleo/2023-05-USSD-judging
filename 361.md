# rebalance() could be Sandwiched for profit

## Summary
Slippage protection is missing leading to bad trades on behalf of the USSD contract, thus anyone could sandwich the `rebalance()` frunction.
## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see in the mentioned code bellow the [`amountOutMinimum`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L237) is set to 0. This means that MEV bots can FrontRun this transaction and trade as much as they want without any restrictions. This is an easy target for MEVs, since the check for slippage and minimum amount received is not implemented, the loss of funds is minor but persistent. Here's an example to illustrate a possible scenario:

**1 Initially, the pool is in a suboptimal state with a ratio of 99.0% (0.99 : 1 | USSD : DAI).**

**2 A user takes advantage of this situation by calling `rebalance()` while simultaneously executing a front-running transaction to buy USSD at a discounted price.**

**3 The `rebalance()` function executes and successfully adjusts the pool to a balanced state with a ratio 
of  99.5% (0.995 : 1 | USSD : DAI).**

**4 The user then sells the previously acquired USSD at a slight profit.**

## Impact
MEV profits on behalf of USSD contract, causing loss of funds.

## Code Snippet
```jsx
    function UniV3SwapInput(
        bytes memory _path,
        uint256 _sellAmount
    ) public override onlyBalancer {
        IV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IV3SwapRouter
            .ExactInputParams({
                path: _path,
                recipient: address(this),
                //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement  `amountOutMinimum` so that this is no longer possible.
