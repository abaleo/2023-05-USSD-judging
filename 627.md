# Swapping tokens is exposed to unlimited slippage.

## Summary
The parameter amountout in the function uniswapv3input is set to 0 meaning there tokens received maybe lower than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since the amountout is set to zero , there is no minimum amount expected after swapping tokens  and this can lead to loss of value which can alter rebalancing.

               //deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _sellAmount,
                amountOutMinimum: 0
            });
        uniRouter.exactInput(params);
    }


## Impact
Loss of value of  assets.
