# Direct transfer of USSD or DAI to the `uniPool` causes `rebalance` to malfunction

## Summary

Because of reliance on `DAI.balanceOf(uniPool)` and `USSD.balanceOf(uniPool)` in `USSDRebalancer.rebalance`, direct transfer of DAI to the pool will cause `rebalance` to buy or mint wrong amounts of USSD.

## Vulnerability Detail

First, let's notice that, when calling `USSDRebalancer.rebalance()`, we use `sqrtPriceX96` from `uniPool.slot0()` to decide whether to call `BuyUSSDSellCollateral`, `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` or do nothing. To see this, examine the following lines of code: [1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L71-L72), [2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L93), [3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L95), [4](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L98)

However, to choose how much USSD to buy for DAI or, in the 2nd case, how much USSD to mint and then sell for DAI, we use `USSD.balanceOf(uniPool)` and `DAI.balanceOf(uniPool)`. To see this, examine the following lines of code: [1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L83-L85), [2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L94), [3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L97), [4](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L104).

Sending DAI (or USSD) to the pool directly influences `DAI.balanceOf(uniPool)` but doesn't influence `sqrtPriceX96` of the pool.

Moreover, notice that Uniswap V3 pools (unlike Uniswap V2 pairs) don't have the `sync` mechanism  that would allow to easily set reserves in the pool to actual balances of tokens in the pool.

This can lead to `DAIamount / 1e12 - USSDamount` values passed to `mintRebalancer` or `BuyUSSDSellCollateral` to be different than expected. Relevant lines of code: [1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#LL97C1-L97C1), [2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L104).

Let's consider a situation where someone has sent some DAI to the pool directly. In this case, it's possible that the price of 1 USSD in the pool is less than 1 DAI (and the [threshold](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L95) is exceeded) but `USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12` is negative (or smaller than expected) because the DAI previously sent directly to the pool didn't influence the price.

If that's the case, then call to `rebalance()` will revert becasue of underflow in `BuyUSSDSellCollateral((USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12) / 2);`. This will DoS the `rebalance()` functionality of USSD, and likely will cause USSD to depeg without option to use collateral in the USSD contract to recover the peg. This will, in turn, cause USSD to lose its value because not many people are comfortable with holding depegged stablecoins.

Even if `USSDamount - DAIamount / 1e12` is not negative, just smaller than expected, then too little USSD will be bought to fully recover the peg.


Now let's consider a situation, in which the price of 1 USSD more than 1 DAI but someone has sent DAI directly to the pool before. This will cause minting more USSD than expected in [this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L104) and overshoot the 1 DAI price for 1 USSD. This situation is intended to be prevented as we can read in the  whitepaper or in comments [in this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSDRebalancer.sol#L100-L101):

>// never sell too much USSD for DAI so it 'overshoots' (becomes more in quantity than DAI on the pool)
>// otherwise could be arbitraged through mint/redeem`


## Impact

If someone sends DAI to the pool directly (by transfer, not by swap), then USSD will depeg because of `USSDRebalancer.rebalance()` rebalancing too little or even reverting.

Another possibility is that selling USSD for DAI in `rebalance` will overshoot and create unwelcome arbitrage opportunities.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Don't rely on `USSD.balanceOf(uniPool)`, `DAI.balanceOf(uniPool)`. Figure out how to achieve intended behavior using `sqrtPriceX96` only.
