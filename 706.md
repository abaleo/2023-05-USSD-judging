# Anybody can call ``mintRebalancer`` or ``burnRebalancer`` and manipulate ``totalSupply``

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L204-L210
Since there is no access control for `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer`, anyone can mint or burn USSD tokens to or from the USSD contract and inflate or deflate the token supply. 

## Impact
Since the USSD contract is not designed to hold USSD, `burnRebalancer` on itself doesn't have any impact.
However `mintRebalancer` does, via `mintRebalancer`, anyone can mint USSD tokens to the contract, inflate the total supply, thereby reduce the collateral factor and impact the flutter selection

or
sell more tokens than rebalancer contract intended and peg down the USSD.

## Recommendation
Consider allowing rebalancer contract only to call `mintRebalancer` and `burnRebalancer`
