# Wrong address used when deploying `StableOracleWBTC` leads increased buy of WBTC when rebalancing

## Summary

When deploying `StableOracleWBTC` the address of the WETH chainlink Oracle is used (`0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419`) instead of the BTC/USD oracle (`0xf4030086522a5beea4988f8ca5b36dbc97bee88c`)

## Vulnerability Detail

When calculating the collateral factor of WBTC when calling the `rebalance` functio,n the much lower price of WETH is used. This leads to a much lower collateral factor for WBTC . This lower collateral factor will lead to unnecessary purchase of WBTC when rebalancing. This overweight of WBTC in the collateral will make USSD less stable since a bigger portion of its collateral value us subject to high volatility.

## Impact

Lets say the price for WBTC is 30,000 USD and the price for WETH is 2000 USD. Using the WETH price to calculate the WBTC collateral factor will make this factor 15 times smaller. This means, when rebalancing, the contract will continue buying WBTC until it is 15 times higher than intended by the developers. This makes the USSD less stable since a bigger portion of its collateral value us subject to high volatility.
