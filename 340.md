# User cannot renounce approval to the uniswap Router

## Summary
 It  needs to consider revoking approvals for tokens when collateral assets are removed or are no longer supported.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `USSD.approveToRouter()` function in the protocol is designed to approve an unlimited amount of tokens by setting the allowance to the maximum possible value (0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff) for a specific token and the UniRouter contract address. However, the protocol does not provide a functionality to revoke or decrease the approved allowance.
This means that once the approveToRouter function is called to approve a token, it cannot be revoked or reduced. This could introduce potential security risks as the approved tokens may be subject to misuse by unauthorized contracts or attackers.
```solidity
    function approveToRouter(address _token) public {
        IERC20Upgradeable(_token).approve(
            address(uniRouter),
            0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        );
    }
```

## Impact
If a collateral asset is removed or is no longer supported by the protocol, it is advisable to consider revoking the approval granted . This is important to prevent any potential misuse or unauthorized access to the approved tokens.

## Recommendation
If there is a need to revoke or reduce the approved allowance, alternative methods or updated contract logic should be employed.
