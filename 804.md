# Project intents to use the role `STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE` but is never created

## Summary
Role is not created and there are no functions to create it
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/cdd6d4e0cf0be40e6e0d64da8b94bd065efad4af/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol#L212C14-L214
Above function is used to create a role.
It is used once in the initializer to create the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

The _setupRole is not configured in the USSD contract and since it's internal, you can't call it from the contract.
Meaning, it's not possible to create the role 
## Impact
It's not possible to create the `STABLE_CONTROL_ROLE` role which needs to be used for several functions.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Call the _setupRole for the controller role in the initializer
