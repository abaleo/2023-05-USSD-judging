# If collateral factor is high enough, flutter ends up being out of bounds

## Summary
In `USSDRebalancer` contract, function `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` will revert everytime a rebalance calls it, provided the collateral factor is greater than all the elements of the `flutterRatios` array.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` calculates `flutter` as the lowest index of the `flutterRatios` array for which the collateral factor is smaller than the flutter ratio.
```solidity
uint256 cf = IUSSD(USSD).collateralFactor();
uint256 flutter = 0;
for (flutter = 0; flutter < flutterRatios.length; flutter++) {
	if (cf < flutterRatios[flutter]) {
	  break;
	}
}
```
The problem arises when, if collateral factor is greater than all flutter values, after the loop `flutter = flutterRatios.length`.

This `flutter` value is used afterwards here:
```solidity
...
if (collateralval * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[i].ratios[flutter]) {
  portions++;
}
...
```
 And here:
 ```solidity
...
if (collateralval * 1e18 / ownval < collateral[i].ratios[flutter]) {
  if (collateral[i].token != uniPool.token0() || collateral[i].token != uniPool.token1()) {
	// don't touch DAI if it's needed to be bought (it's already bought)
	IUSSD(USSD).UniV3SwapInput(collateral[i].pathbuy, daibought/portions);
  }
}
...
```

As we can see in the tests of the project, the flutterRatios array and the collateral ratios array are set to be of the same length, so if flutter = flutterRatios.length, any call to that index in the `ratios` array will revert with an index out of bounds.

## Impact
High, when the collateral factor reaches certain level, a rebalance that calls `SellUSSDBuyCollateral` will always revert.

## Tool used
Manual review.


## Recommendation
When checking `collateral[i].ratios[flutter]` always check first that flutter is `< flutterRatios.length`.
