# inital mint of 10_000 USSD is problematic

## Summary
No collateral for the first minted tokens can set off a downward spiral if USSD loses value in the beginning.

## Vulnerability Detail
When USSD is initialized, 10_000 USSD are sent to the owner:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/USSD.sol#L41-L42
```solidity
File: USSD.sol

41:        // mint 10k USSD to create initial pool
42:        _mint(msg.sender, 10_000 * 1e6);
```

The issue is that these are non-backed USSD. When these are used to initialize the liquidity in the uniswap pool there will be no way for USSD to rebalance where the token to lose in price.

This can set off a downward spiral since if the project cannot recover it is unlikely someone would provide this collateral for a token losing in value.

## Impact
When the project starts, if the value of USSD goes down. There is no collateral to buy USSD with hence no way for the protocol to recover. Since it cannot recover there is little likelihood that someone would provide collateral as the peg to DAI is lost.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't mint the first 10_000 but instead use `mintForToken` to provide collateral and use these tokens to initialize the uni pool.
