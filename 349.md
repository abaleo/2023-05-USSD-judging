# removing collateral will lock tokens in contract

## Summary
Removing a collateral will lock all tokens not yet traded in the `USSD` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
When minting USSD a user provides a collateral. The user then gets USSD minted for this collateral. The protocol has the option to remove a collateral as well, perhaps if it turns out to be too volatile to be used.

Since the only way of getting collateral out of the contract is through rebalancing, if the token is removed as collateral all the existing balance at time of removal will be locked.

## Impact
If a collateral is removed, due to it being to volotile perhaps, all tokens provided will be locked in the `USSD` contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only allow removal if there are no tokens left in the contract. Or add a withdraw function.
